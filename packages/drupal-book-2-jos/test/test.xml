    <title>Overview, Life and Natural Selection</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to &lt;strong&gt;Biology 110: Concepts of Biology and Biodiversity&lt;/strong&gt;. This course is designed to provide you with an overview of the major themes of biology and to introduce you to the diversity of life on the planet. These tutorials, in conjunction with the Mastering Biology assignments and the laboratory exercises will help you learn the course material. In this first tutorial you will learn how the tutorials work and you will also get an introduction to natural selection,&amp;nbsp;evolution, and the nature of science, which are major unifying themes in modern biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These readings are designed to help you understand important topics in biology - you will read about various topics, view figures, visit related Web sites, and listen to embedded mini-lectures. Take an active part in your learning by taking notes in your own words and thinking critically about the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this tutorial you should be able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the structure of the tutorials and how they will help you to learn the course material&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understand the different types of assignments in the &lt;em&gt;Mastering Biology&lt;/em&gt; online homework package&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;List the basic properties common to all living organisms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Define biological evolution and natural selection&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain how, over time, natural selection results in organisms that are more well-adapted to their environment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</body>

    <title>What is Life?</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Biology is the study of&amp;nbsp;life. But, what is life? We all recognize it, but defining it can be a challenge and there is no single perfect definition.&amp;nbsp; Some features of living things include: order, the need for energy, growth and development, regulation of one's internal environment, the ability to reproduce, the ability to respond to one's external environment, and evolutionary adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will begin our study of life by examining how life behaves over successive generations. Life is not static, and it changes with time. The next section discusses how life changes or "evolves" as a result of natural selection.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Natural Selection and Evolution</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The title of this course is &lt;em&gt;Concepts of Biology and Biodiversity&lt;/em&gt;. Biological&lt;strong&gt; evolution&lt;/strong&gt; (defined most succinctly as changes in the genetic structure of a population) is an important process in biology, and it explains the diversity of life that exists in our world (the images below show the evolution of major life forms through geologic time). We now know that all life is related and can be traced back to a common ancestor that existed approximately 3.7 billion years ago. In the vast time since life first appeared, evolution has resulted in a continuous branching of new species that can be described as a tree of life. Rooted firmly at the bottom is life's common ancestor, whereas modern species reside at the tree's tips; the vast branching that exists between the two describes the history of life on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this class, evolution will be a reoccurring theme. Whenever appropriate, we will discuss how evolutionary processes have shaped life's diversity and &lt;strong&gt;adaptations&lt;/strong&gt; (adaptations are traits that help an organism survive in its current environment). As you will learn, evolution has many facets that have contributed to the diversity of life. However, only one process adapts life to the environment; this process is natural selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2944|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed][ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2946|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is Natural Selection?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Natural selection&lt;/strong&gt; is a process by which a population becomes better adapted to its' environment over time (a more succinct definition of natural selection is “differential reproduction” – the best adapted individuals are more likely to reproduce then less well adapted individuals).&amp;nbsp; However, environments are always changing and thus the adaptations in an environment also change.&amp;nbsp; Changing environments drive evolution via natural selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the most fundamental level, natural selection results in changes in the frequency of certain genes and/or alleles over successive generations within a population. In order for natural selection to act on a population, there must be genetic variation in the population and the genes and alleles that are selected for are the ones that result in adaptation.&amp;nbsp; As you might gather, genetics and genetic diversity play an important role in understanding natural selection and this course will include a study of genetics.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Features of the Biology 110 Tutorials</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Each tutorial will include an "&lt;strong&gt;Introduction and Learning Objectives&lt;/strong&gt;" section . This section provides an overview of the tutorial. You might find it helpful to go back to this section after you complete the tutorial and see if you understand the major objectives. A good test for comprehension, upon completing the tutorial, is to pull out a piece of paper and draw out some of the main points of each objective. Remember, the more actively you use these tutorials, the more beneficial they will be to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each tutorial also includes embedded mini-lectures.&amp;nbsp; These mini-lectures are intended to reinforce the important concepts in the tutorial.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, some of the mini-lectures include practice problems for you to work through and follow-up explanations for how to work through the problems.&amp;nbsp; Please be sure to listen to these mini-lectures and work through the practice problems - you will be responsible for this information for the quizzes and exams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the reading, there is a "&lt;strong&gt;Terms&lt;/strong&gt;" list.&amp;nbsp; You should have a working knowledge of these terms and understand how they are used in the tutorials. The terms appear in bold when they are first defined in the tutorial. If you form a study group (and we suggest you do this), then practice using these new words with your study partners. Some students find it helpful to use 3x5 cards with the word on the front and the definition on the back to help them learn the more difficult terms. If you use this method, write the definition in your own words because this will help clarify the meaning of the term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reinforce the tutorial concepts, you will do assignments in an online homework system (&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mastering Biology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;).&amp;nbsp; There are three kinds of assignments:&amp;nbsp; Quick Checks that are intended to allow you to see if you understand the basics of the course material, homework assignments that will explore the topics more fully and are typically due after we discuss the material in class, and a quiz before each lecture exam.&amp;nbsp; All of the due dates for these assignments are included in your lecture syllabus as well as on the calendar in &lt;em&gt;Mastering Biology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being successful in a college course requires a different set of learning strategies than is required for a high school course and you will most likely need to adjust your learning habits accordingly.&amp;nbsp; In general, college-level coursework requires you to be &lt;strong&gt;metacognitive&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp; This means that you are have achieved the ability to understand what you know about the course content and what you do not know.&amp;nbsp; Penn State has many resources available to help you improve your metacognitive learning strategies.&amp;nbsp; These include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dus.psu.edu/academicsuccess/studyskills.html" target="_blank"&gt;Study Skills Modules from DUS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://istudy.psu.edu/tutorials/" target="_blank"&gt;iStudy for Success! Online Learning Tutorials&lt;/a&gt; (pay particular attention to the tutorial titled "Active Reading")&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://science.psu.edu/advising/success/studyskills.html" target="_blank"&gt;The Eberly College of Science Study Skills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, this course uses Learning Assistants (LAs).&amp;nbsp; LAs are undergraduate students who have successfully completed this course and are here to help you learn the course material and improve your metacognition and learning strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LAs are familiar with the learning strategies from the&lt;a href="http://www.learningscientists.org/" target="_blank"&gt; LearningScientists.org&lt;/a&gt;. This is a group of cognitive psychological scientists interested in research on education. Their main research focus is on the science of learning and they have put together some helpful tools to help you improve your learning strategies.&amp;nbsp; The short video below is a useful place to start developing your skills!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Real Life Example of Evolution and Natural Selection</title>

&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2264|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evolution Canyons I and II are found in Israel in the Carmel and Galilee mountain ranges (the image above shows Evolution Canyon I (ECI) in Lower Nahal Oren, Mount Carmel, Israel). These areas are ideal for the study of evolution because each range has a north-facing slope with relatively temperate environmental conditions and a south-facing slope with relatively extreme UV radiation (the south-facing slopes receive 200--800% more solar radiation than north-facing slopes), daily temperature variation, and arid conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists are interested in exploring how these different environmental conditions lead to evolutionary changes in organisms. An example of an evolutionary change is a change in coat color in mammals. Many mammals, particularly prey organisms, have evolved coat coloration that matches their environment in order to provide camouflage from predators. Singaravelan et al (2010) investigated how hair melanin content of spiny mice (&lt;em&gt;Acomys cahirinus&lt;/em&gt;) has evolved in response to alternative selection pressures inflicted by contrasting colored habitats of Evolution Canyon. There are two main forms of melanin: pheomelanin results in yellow to brown hair color and eumelanin results in gray to black hair color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Based on this information, do you expect mice that live on the “African” slopes to have higher pheomelanin content in their hair or higher eumelanin? What do you expect of mice living on the “European” slopes?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain how a change in environmental conditions can result in an evolutionary change in a population.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reference&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Carbon and Life</title>
    <body>&lt;h2 id="CarbonandLife-IntroductionandLearningObjectives"&gt;Introduction and Learning Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is composed of a diversity of biomolecules (molecules found in living organisms). With all of life's diversity, however, there is a ubiquitous presence of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. Carbon plays a particularly important role in these molecules by virtue of its unique chemical properties. In this tutorial you will learn why some biomolecules readily interact with water, and why some do not. We will examine how relatively simple subunits, known as monomers, can be linked together by chemical bonds to make much larger complex macromolecules, known as polymers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this tutorial you should be able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the structure of a water molecule and how it&amp;nbsp;interacts with other water molecules&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain the basic properties of water&amp;nbsp;and the importance of these properties to organisms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain how carbon is the backbone of biological molecules&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Define and give examples of anabolic and catabolic reactions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the basic structure of the monomer(s) and polymer(s), and the functions of each of the major groups of molecules in cells and organisms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</body>

    <title>Properties of Water</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) is fundamental to the existence of life as we know it. Indeed, it is so familiar to us that we take its properties for granted. What makes water so important? What is the relationship between water and other biomolecules? In order to answer these questions we need to take a close look at water and at some of the properties of its electrons, which have a profound influence on its character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you have probably already learned, a single molecule of water consists of two hydrogen atoms covalently bound to one oxygen atom. This arrangement does not sound very exciting; however, a closer examination of the bonds within the water molecule reveals something unique. Specifically, water is a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;polar&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;molecule, meaning that it has different electrical properties on opposite ends; specifically, it has two partial positive charges in association with the two H-atoms, and two partial negative charges associated with the oxygen atom. [ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2272|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand these properties, you need to know that not all&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;covalent bonds&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(those bonds that involve the sharing of electrons) are equal. Specifically, oxygen is highly&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;electronegative&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and tends to pull electrons close to it when forming covalent bonds with hydrogen. This creates an unequal distribution around each O-H bond; therefore, the hydrogen has a partial positive charge (and conversely, the oxygen has a slightly negative character). Importantly, the partial negative charges on one water molecule can interact with the partial positive charges on another water molecule to form a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;hydrogen bond&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp; See the image above to see the structure of a water molecule as well as how individual water molecules interact with each other via hydrogen bonds (the h-bonds are indicated with the dashed lines). Hydrogen bonds contribute to many of the unique features of water.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>More About Water</title>
    <body>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2279|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed] Water exhibits &lt;strong&gt;cohesion&lt;/strong&gt;. Cohesion is a physical property of particles or molecules of the same substance sticking together and water is cohesive due to hydrogen-bonding between neighboring water molecules. Due to cohesion, water has a high &lt;strong&gt;surface tension&lt;/strong&gt; (resistance to disruption at the surface). This property is exploited by many insects (as seen in the image above) and some vertebrates (e.g., basilisk lizards), which can actually stand or run on water without breaking the surface and falling through.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water is a repository for heat due to its high &lt;strong&gt;specific heat&lt;/strong&gt;. This means that it takes a relatively large amount of energy to raise the temperature of water. Therefore, water absorbs (and stores) heat energy more efficiently than many other substances. Biologically, this is extremely important because large bodies of water tend to have relatively stable temperatures, whereas the air around them may fluctuate. The moderate temperatures in oceans and large lakes make them suitable year-round for an abundance of aquatic life. Water also has a relatively high &lt;strong&gt;heat of vaporization&lt;/strong&gt;, therefore, water is relatively resistant to phase changes. (It takes a relatively large amount of energy to break all of the H-bonds in water to produce water vapor or steam.) This property allows some organisms to use water, in the form of sweat, to cool down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2281|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water expands during freezing. When water molecules slow down and ice forms (below the freezing point), the hydrogen bonds stabilize and keep water molecules at a distance from each other in a characteristic, 3-dimensional crystal. As a results, ice is less dense than liquid water and ice floats. The distinction between ice and liquid water is illustrated in this figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water is an excellent &lt;strong&gt;solvent&lt;/strong&gt;, capable of dissolving many compounds. The polar character of water means that anything with a charge can dissolve in water. NaCl is table salt, and when added to water its sodium and chloride atoms disassociate. These ions have a charge. Both the positively charged sodium ions (Na+) and negatively charged chloride ions (Cl-) can readily bond to the polar water molecules and in doing so they dissolve. Compounds that dissolve readily in water are &lt;strong&gt;hydrophilic&lt;/strong&gt;. Compounds that do not interact with water are &lt;strong&gt;hydrophobic&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an important class of molecules that have the unique ability to be both hydrophobic and hydrophilic, a property termed &lt;strong&gt;amphipathic&lt;/strong&gt;. An amphipathic molecule has one end with some charge character, and the other end lacking charge. Phospholipid macromolecules are amphipathic. We will see the importance of these molecules in the discussion of phospholipids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, water has many important properties that are important to life. The cells of terrestrial organisms (including ours) contain greater than 70% water, and most cells are surrounded by water. This means that a large percentage of biomolecules operate in an aqueous compartment. It should not surprise you to learn that water plays an important role in the functioning of biochemicals. In the next few sections you will learn about four classes of biomolecules and about how their unique characteristics (and synthesis) involve water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="450" src="https://voicethread.com/app/player/?threadId=2120770" width="800"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is comprised of organic and inorganic compounds.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Inorganic compounds&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;include water and mineral rocks. An inorganic compound does not contain carbon (with the exception of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;and several other C-containing molecules which are classified as inorganic molecules). In contrast,&lt;strong&gt;organic compounds&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;contain carbon and are prevalent in living systems. They provide us with colors, tastes, and odors, along with the abilities to perceive and respond to our environment. In other words, carbon compounds are essential to our existence. What is it about carbon that makes it so fundamental to life on Earth?&amp;nbsp; Carbon has four&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;electrons&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(a negatively charged part of an atom) in its outermost orbital. This&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;valence&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;of four allows each carbon atom to form stable associations with up to four other atoms, including other carbon atoms. Carbon can form single, double, or triple bonds. That is, it can share one, two, or three of its valence electrons with another atom. By convention, a single, double, or triple line is used to denote these different types of bonds. A single carbon atom bound to another carbon atom is the building block for a seemingly endless variety of chain- and ring-structured molecules. The images on this page represent a small portion of the thousands of organic compounds that exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial we will address four classes of large organic compounds (&lt;strong&gt;macromolecules&lt;/strong&gt;): carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Note that three of these (carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids) are actually formed through the synthesis of many similar or identical building blocks. These building blocks (monomers) are linked to form polymers. The general process of joining monomers to form a polymer is termed&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;anabolism&lt;/strong&gt;, which can involve many steps. Conversely, a polymer can be broken down into its monomers by&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;catabolism&lt;/strong&gt;, which also can involve multiple steps.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Hydrolysis and Condensation</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;There are thousands of different types of biochemical reactions. Although they may involve the joining or breaking down of a myriad of molecules, most use the same basic chemical reaction. Anabolic reactions typically involve the joining of monomers by the removal of a water molecule. In this case a hydroxide (OH) is removed from one molecule and a hydrogen (H) is removed from the adjacent combining molecule. This type of reaction, termed&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;condensation synthesis&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(or&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;dehydration synthesis&lt;/strong&gt;), is illustrated in the animation shown here. Select condensation, and hit play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hydrolysis-condensation&gt;&lt;/hydrolysis-condensation&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This animation also depicts a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;hydrolysis&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;reaction (a type of catabolism whereby a polymer is broken down by the addition of water).&amp;nbsp; Hit the "home" icon to return to the beginning; select condensation and hit play.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Carbohydrates</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carbohydrate&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;biomolecules generally have a basic structural formula that is written as C(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)n. For example, glucose has the structural formula C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. The carbohydrates have many functions in cells. They can be used for energy storage (e.g., starch) and as structural molecules (e.g., cellulose). And as we will see, they also play a role in genetic information storage in &lt;strong&gt;nucleic acids&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(organic compounds that make up RNA and DNA).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic monomer of carbohydrates are the simple sugars (&lt;strong&gt;monosaccharides&lt;/strong&gt;). Monosaccharides include glucose (also known as dextrose), fructose, ribose, galactose, and ribulose. Note, the -ose suffix is used by chemists to describe all carbohydrates.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;disaccharide&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a sugar formed by a condensation reaction between two monosaccharides. Condensation synthesis of maltose (glucose + glucose), a common disaccharide, is illustrated in the following animation. Other disaccharides include sucrose (glucose + fructose) and lactose (glucose + galactose); sucrose is common table sugar, and lactose is milk sugar.&amp;nbsp; Many disaccharides are sweet tasting and are used as a source of energy for cell metabolism.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This animation shows the formation of disaccharides.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;disaccharide-formation&gt;&lt;/disaccharide-formation&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More complex forms of carbohydrates can be synthesized by cells via additional condensation reactions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Polysaccharide&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;polymers can consist of up to several thousand monomers of simple sugars. The type of polysaccharide is determined by the number, type, and arrangement of its monomers. Starch is a polymer of glucose monomers. It is used by plants to store surplus sugar and when we and other animals eat a starchy plant (such as a potato) we use the starch for energy and nutrients. Animals store surplus sugar in their livers in the form of a molecule known as&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;glycogen&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2294|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]Cellulose, another polymer of glucose, is an important component of plant cell walls; it is also the most abundant polymer on the planet. Although humans cannot digest cellulose, it is a valuable part of our diet because this "fiber" helps to maintain a healthy digestive tract. Some animals, such as the crab shown here, and fungi use another polysaccharide, chitin, for structural purposes.

    <title>Lipids</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lipids&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;are an assortment of molecules so diverse that it may seem odd to group them together. However, they do share one common trait; they are all (to some extent) hydrophobic. Also, in contrast to the other groups of macromolecules, the lipids are&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;polymers. The lipids main biological functions include energy storage (e.g., fats), the main structural components of cell membranes (e.g., phospholipids and cholesterol), and hormones and other cell signaling molecules (e.g., estrogen and testosterone). The lipids include dietary fats (also known as&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;triacylglycerols&lt;/strong&gt;),&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;phospholipids&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;(which are an important component of cell membranes), and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;steroids&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(e.g., cholesterol, estrogen and testosterone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fats and oils are triacylglycerols, which are formed when three fatty acid molecules and one glycerol molecule join via condensation synthesis. This animation depicts the synthesis of a triacylglycerol molecule. The following animation shows synthesis of a fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;&lt;div style="max-width:65em;"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2296|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;&lt;fat-synthesis-element style="max-width:40em;"&gt; &lt;/fat-synthesis-element&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fats can be saturated or unsaturated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Saturated fats&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;do not have double bonds in their hydrocarbon chains and each carbon is bound to two other carbons and two hydrogens.&lt;strong&gt;Unsaturated fats&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;have double bonds along their lengths (monounsaturated = one double bond, polyunsaturated = more than one double bond). Saturated fats have straight chains that organize into more tightly packed arrangements. In contrast, unsaturated fats have kinks caused by the double bonds, which do not permit tight packing. Thus, saturated fats tend to be solids at room temperature, whereas unsaturated fats are usually liquid. A liquid unsaturated fat can be converted to a solid saturated fat by a process called hydrogenation (e.g., margarine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fats are used in energy storage, protection, and insulation. Aquatic and polar mammals counteract heat loss by having extra fat for insulation. Compare the Arctic polar bear and subtropical gazelle. Clearly, they don't have a similar need for extra insulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the fats,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;phospholipids&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;are amphipathic molecules that have only two fatty acids molecules, and a glycerol joined to a phosphate group. This figure depicts this arrangement of two hydrophobic "tails" attached to a hydrophilic "head" (the phosphate group is charged, allowing it to dissolve in water). This unique structure forms the basis for the phospholipid bilayer of cell membranes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;&lt;div style="max-width:65em;"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2301|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2950|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style="clear: left;"&gt;Another group of lipids, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;steroids&lt;/strong&gt;, is characterized by a four-fused ring structure. The steroids include cholesterol, and some hormones (e.g., estrogen and testosterone) produced from cholesterol. Cholesterol is an important component of cell membranes and the vertebrate animal sex hormones estrogen and testosterone are synthesized from cholesterol. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Proteins</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2952|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proteins&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;are polymers that are functionally and structurally diverse. The digestive enzymes that break apart your food are proteins. The pigment that affects skin color, melanin, is a protein. Silk is a protein. Proteins move your muscles, attack invading bacteria and viruses, and transport oxygen to all of the cells in your body. The main biological functions of proteins include structural and mechanical roles (e.g, actin and myosin in muscle cells), and their roles as enzymes (e.g., amylase – a digestive enzyme).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic monomer of proteins is the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;amino acid&lt;/strong&gt;. The general structure of an amino acid is shown here. Note, this basic structure contains an "R" group that is variable in chemical composition. Typically there are twenty different R-groups, and hence the same number of commonly seen amino acids.These figures show the twenty different amino acids and their R-groups. Note that the amino acids are classified as nonpolar, polar, or charged based on the chemical characteristics of the R-groups.&amp;nbsp; How will these different R-groups behave in water?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2954|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2956|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed][ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2958|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polypeptides&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;are a polymer (chain) of amino acids. Proteins consist of one or more polypeptide chains arranged in a specific conformation. The order of amino acids in a particular polypeptide chain is determined by the specific gene for that chain. In other words, every polypeptide chain has a corresponding gene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The animation shown here illustrates the formation of a polypeptide. Do not simply think of proteins as linear strings of amino acids. In reality, they fold into a three-dimensional structure and take on complex shapes (basic protein structure is discussed in the Real Life Example on the next page).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;peptide-formation-element&gt;&lt;/peptide-formation-element&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Real Life Example: The role of protein structure and function in a human genetic disease</title>
    <body>&lt;p id="CarbonandLife-ARealLifeExample:Theroleofproteinstructureandfunctioninahumangeneticdisease"&gt;A recurring theme in biology is that structure is related to function. This theme is particularly important in understanding proteins. Humans have tens of thousands of different proteins and each has a specific structure and function. Despite the diversity of proteins, they are all constructed from the same 20 amino acids. Different proteins have different sequences of these 20 amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sequence of amino acids in a protein is referred to as its&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;primary&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;structure. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;secondary&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;structure of a protein refers to regions of the molecule that are coiled or folded (α helices or β pleated sheets).&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Tertiary&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;structure refers to the overall shape of the protein due to interactions between the side chains (R groups) of the amino acids. Some proteins are made of more than one polypeptide chain – the aggregation of these polypeptide chains refers to a protein’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;quaternary&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;structure. A change in a protein’s primary structure results in a change in the overall structure of the protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sickle-cell is a genetic disease that results in the abnormal production of the protein hemoglobin which causes misshapen red blood cells. The abnormality is in the 6th position of the β subunit of the molecule. Normal hemoglobin has a glutamic acid while sickle-cell hemoglobin has a valine in the 6th position. The presence of the valine causes hemoglobin molecules to aggregate together into rod formations. These rods of hemoglobin are not effective at carrying oxygen. People with sickle-cell anemia suffer episodes of “sickle-cell crises” which are painful and, left untreated, can lead to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refer to the figure below&amp;nbsp;and use your understanding of the chemical behavior of the R groups to predict what would happen if the glutamic acid in the 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;position of the β subunit was replaced with an aspartic acid (instead of valine). Would this cause more or less disruption to the function of the resulting hemoglobin?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nucleic acids include&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;deoxyribonucleic acid&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;(DNA) and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;ribonucleic acid&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;(RNA). DNA and RNA work together to affect the synthesis of proteins. Nucleic acid molecules are polymers of nucleotides, which are simple structures that consist of a sugar, a phosphate, and a nitrogenous base.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Nitrogenous bases&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;are ringed structures consisting of nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DNA and RNA consist of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, RNA nucleotides have ribose as their sugar and any one of the following nitrogenous bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and uracil. DNA nucleotides have deoxyribose as their sugar and any one of the following nitrogenous bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine (shown below).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figure below illustrates how nucleotide monomers are joined to make a nucleic acid polymer; in this case a DNA double helix.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DNA usually exists as paired strands, with the two sides held together by hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous bases. Specifically, cytosine will bind to guanine, and thymine to adenine. However, RNA is typically a single-stranded molecule.The roles of DNA and RNA will be discussed in more detail in future tutorials.

    <title>Summary</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;This tutorial focused on basic biochemistry. Many of life's chemical processes involve the synthesis of larger molecules from smaller building blocks, in an event that is generally termed anabolism. These larger molecules can then be broken down in a process that is termed catabolism. Later in the course we will examine some specific anabolic events and how they contribute to the life of a growing organism. We will also examine how catabolic events can be used to convert energy that is necessary to sustain life. To understand these biochemical events, it is important to know some basic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our bodies are comprised of over 70% water. All life on the planet depends on this molecule, and you should be aware of the polar character of this molecule and how polarity affects the ability of one water molecule to interact with another water molecule, as well as with other polar molecules. Water is an excellent solvent and is capable of dissolving a variety of polar molecules. A molecule that can readily interact with water is a hydrophilic molecule, and one that does not interact with water is a hydrophobic molecule. Not all molecules have a strictly hydrophilic/hydrophobic character; some have both and are termed amphipathic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon is a very important element for life. Due to its chemical versatility, it is found in thousands of compounds within living organisms. To understand biochemistry, you need to have a fundamental understanding of the major classes of molecules that are composed of carbon. Additionally, it is important to understand the relationship between these carbon-containing molecules and water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipids are a class of carbon-containing molecules that have a hydrophobic character. They either totally lack any polar characteristics or their polar character is limited to a small area of the molecule. Be sure that you understand how the polar character of a molecule influences its ability to interact with water. Fats are lipids that are solid at room temperature and that do not readily interact with water. On the other hand, oils are lipids that are liquid at room and that do not readily interact with water. Phospholipids are a class of lipids that have amphipathic properties, and they are a major component of cellular membranes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbohydrates are another class of carbon-bearing molecules, and they are used by the cell for energy storage and as structural molecules. Later in the course you will learn how energy is extracted from monosaccharides in the processes of glycolysis and cellular respiration. Carbohydrates are also found as polysaccharides, which are involved in energy storage and in building various cellular components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proteins are composed of amino acids (there are twenty naturally occurring amino acids), and these subunits are linked together to form polypeptide chains. A protein may be comprised of a single polypeptide chain (which is encoded by a single gene), or it may be comprised of two or more polypeptides (each polypeptide chain may be encoded for by a separate gene). Proteins play a variety of roles within the living organism. They can catalyze various chemical reactions (catabolic and anabolic), and they can form structural elements. Additionally, some proteins can convert chemical energy into mechanical energy; such proteins are involved in various motor activities within organisms.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>How Old is the Earth?</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The available astronomical data indicate that the universe is about 13.7 billion years old. This estimate is based, in part, on the observation that the universe is constantly expanding. Astronomers have plotted the trajectories (directional movement) of various stars and galaxies and determined that all matter in the known universe arose from a common point. In an event often referred to as the "Big Bang," the universe arose in a relatively brief moment in time and matter was flung outward from this central origin. Since this beginning, this vast amount of matter has been hurling through space, undergoing a number of many changes as it traverses the cosmos. By using radiometric dating techniques (discussed later in this tutorial) of pristine meteorites, astronomers have determined that our own solar system formed 4.55 - 4.56 billion years ago. The &lt;a href="http://hubblesite.org/gallery/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Hubble telescope&lt;/a&gt; was dispatched in 1990 to explore the far reaches of our galaxy and to photograph astronomical events such as star formation. Astronomers use images captured by the Hubble telescope to further our understanding of the origin of the universe and solar systems.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Conditions on Early Earth
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The atmosphere on early Earth was strikingly different from that of today. Primitive Earth's atmosphere consisted of methane, ammonia, hydrogen, water vapor, and a negligible amount of free oxygen. This is an important point because if there was a lot of free oxygen available, life probably could not have arisen from inorganic compounds. This is because oxygen tends to &lt;strong&gt;oxidize&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;substances, which means that electrons are removed. Importantly, the early atmosphere was highly &lt;strong&gt;reducing&lt;/strong&gt; (capable of gaining electrons and forming more complex molecules).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Evidence for the Chemical Evolution of Life
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Darwin wrote of "some warm little pond" in which life could have begun. While this idea was initially scorned, in reality, he might not have been too far from the truth. About forty years later the Scotsman, John Haldane, and the Russian, Alexander Oparin, independently developed a model that has been called the primordial soup model for the origin of life. Basically this model suggests that complex, metabolically active molecules could arise from a slurry of simple chemicals occurring in the right proportions. This idea was tested in 1953 by Stanley Miller and Harold Urey in their classic but quite simple experiment. In the Miller-Urey experiment, a mixture of gases (methane, ammonia, hydrogen, and water vapor) representing the primitive atmosphere was subjected to an electrical discharge. This figure shows their experimental set up. The compounds formed were then condensed and sampled. The solution was found to contain a variety of organic compounds, including aldehydes, carboxylic acid, and amino acids. Thereby, Miller and Urey affirmed that organic compounds could arise in abiotic conditions similar to those that existed on early Earth.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2970|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Miller-Urey experiment has often been repeated, and similar set-ups have generated various organic compounds (including ATP when phosphate is added to the initial slurry). However, there are still various aspects about abiotic synthesis of organic compounds that stimulate much debate. For instance, many scientists feel that the essential ingredients for these early chemical reactions could have come from deep-sea vents in Earth's oceans or from submerged volcanoes, rather than from the early atmosphere. Also, the first cells might have been &lt;strong&gt;autotrophs&lt;/strong&gt;, using inorganic sulfur and iron compounds to gain energy, rather than consuming organic molecules (&lt;strong&gt;heterotrophs&lt;/strong&gt;). Ultimately, these laboratory simulations give us insight into how the chemicals necessary for life could have formed.

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Early Earth
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our own limited lifespan could lead us to believe that Earth is a stable structure, however, geological data indicate that Earth has changed radically since its origin 4.5 billion years ago. In fact, Earth's surface is dynamic. Earth's crust consists of large plates that move with respect to each other. This movement, termed &lt;strong&gt;plate tectonics&lt;/strong&gt;, is due to activity at spreading centers and subduction zones. As a result of this crust movement, the continents are constantly rearranging themselves in a phenomenon known as &lt;strong&gt;continental drift&lt;/strong&gt;. When two plates intersect, any number of geological events (e.g., mountain building, volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes) can result. Continental drift can be measured by a variety of techniques, and geologists have discovered that different land masses drift at different rates. The slowest rates of movement are about 2.5 cm/year, whereas the fastest are around 15 cm/year. Given the vast amount of water on the planet, this redistribution of land also influences ocean partitioning and water levels. (changes in climate also influence water distributions.) In the last 4 billion years, many changes in landmasses have occurred on the planet. About 250 million years ago, all of the landmasses were joined as a supercontinent that geologists named &lt;strong&gt;Pangaea&lt;/strong&gt;. About 180 million years ago, Pangaea began to break apart into the Northern Laurasia and Southern Gondwana landmasses, which eventually separated to create the landmasses that exist today. The history of a supercontinent explains many of the similarities observed in modern organisms on separate landmasses.

    <title>The Fossil Record and Dating Techniques</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The best evidence about the origin of life and the evolution of living organisms comes from the fossil record. &lt;strong&gt;Fossils&lt;/strong&gt; can be preserved remnants of organisms (e.g., bones and teeth) or whole organisms embedded in amber, acid bogs and tar pits, or anywhere bacteria can't decompose a dead body. The fossil record is not complete and has gaps. This is, in part, because not all organisms are equally likely to fossilize. Organisms with hard body parts fossilized more often than those who lacked hard body parts. Organisms that lived near water and in areas of low oxygen were also more likely to form fossils than organisms who lived away from water. Organisms from large populations are typically more common in the fossil record than organisms from small populations; however, if none of the other conditions are in place, large population size is less&amp;nbsp;important.&amp;nbsp; Fossils can also be found in other forms (e.g., an animal's footprint). A scientist who studies fossils is a paleontologist. Fossils are divided into age groups according to a &lt;strong&gt;geological time scale&lt;/strong&gt;, a classification of different periods in Earth’s history. For example, layers of rock bearing evidence of the origin of most modern animal phyla would be classified as belonging to the Cambrian period in the Paleozoic era. Layers of rock bearing fossils suggest a rapid diversification of reptiles took place during the Permian period in the Paleozoic era. While you will not need to know the different periods and epochs for this course, you should be familiar with the four great eras of the geological time scale: Precambrian (oldest), Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic; and you should know that we are currently in the Quaternary period of the Cenozoic era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2976|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed] [ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2978|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Relative Dating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best source of fossils is &lt;strong&gt;sedimentary rock&lt;/strong&gt;, which is formed by layers of minerals that settle out of water. Over time these minerals build up and pack the layers lying beneath them, along with any organisms that have settled with the sediments. The figure below summarizes the major events associated with the formation of sedimentary rock. Note that each stratum, or layer, represents a particular period in Earth's history and is characterized by a collection of fossils of organisms that lived at that time. The location of fossils in sedimentary rock is indicative of their relative age. This means that one fossil can generally be classified as older than another based on their relative position in the sedimentary rock. Deeper layers were formed earlier and their fossils are older than those found in more shallow layers of rock. This method of estimating the relative age of a fossil is known as &lt;strong&gt;relative dating&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2980|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Absolute Dating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variety of methods are used to estimate a fossil's age in years, rather than simply in relative terms. These absolute dating methods include radiometric dating and dendrochronology. These methods will be explored below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Radiometric Dating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The identity of a particular atom is determined by the number of protons it has in its nucleus. However, a collection of atoms of a particular element can have varying numbers of neutrons. For example, hydrogen atoms can have no neutrons (the most common form, sometimes called protium), one neutron (deuterium) or two neutrons (tritium). These are hydrogen's three &lt;strong&gt;isotopes&lt;/strong&gt;. Moreover, different isotopes have different (but predictable) stabilities. Many elements have radioactive isotopes; their nuclei decay at predictable rates (unique for each isotope) and give off energy and atomic particles. When the decay leads to a change in the number of protons, it transforms the atom to an atom of a different element. For example, potassium-40 decays from a radioactive parent atom to a stable daughter atom of argon-40. Scientists have identified several elements with radioactive isotopes that decay at known rates; they can be used to date various rocks, including those containing fossils. This procedure is known as &lt;strong&gt;radiometric dating&lt;/strong&gt;, and as mentioned earlier, this absolute dating method has been used to date material as old as meteorites. Let's take a closer look at how this method works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2984|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This graph illustrates how, over time, radioactive parent atoms decay and the number of stable daughter atoms, relative to the number of parent atoms, increases exponentially. Note how the two lines intersect at the first &lt;strong&gt;half-life&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;point. In other words, a radioisotope's half-life is the amount of time it takes for one-half of the parental atom population to decay into daughter atoms. It takes 1.25 billion years for half of the potassium-40 in a sample to decay to argon-40; in other words, the half-life of potassium-40 is 1.25 billion years. Because living things contain so much carbon, radiometric dating using carbon-14 (C&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;), also called &lt;strong&gt;radiocarbon dating&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;or &lt;strong&gt;carbon-14 dating&lt;/strong&gt;, is quite common. What does carbon-14 decay into? Do a web search to find the answer to this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Do We Know That C-14 Dating is Accurate?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does subatomic physics help establish an absolute dating method for fossils? Easy, well in theory at least; the technical details of how this is done can be a bit complex. As long as an organism is alive, it incorporates C&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;and C&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; into its body. Once an organism dies it no longer takes up new &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C and the &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C already in its tissues radioactively decays. The &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C in its tissues remains the same because it is not radioactive and does not decay. By measuring the ratio of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C to &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C and comparing it to the ratio of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C to &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C present originally in the atmosphere, scientists can calculate the age of a fossil. The rate at which carbon decays (its half-life) is approximately 5730 years. After about 50,000 years, the amount of C&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; remaining is so small that material can't be dated reliably (although some specialized samples have been dated to about 75,000 years). How do we know this radiometric “clock” is accurate? In order to have confidence in a scientific fact, corroboration is required. In other words, without an independent means of verifying a fact, its scientific value is questionable. The more a fact is checked using different methods, the more reliable the scientific community judges that fact. Many experiments have verified the usefulness and accuracy of carbon-14 dating. For example, archaeologists know from the historical record the age of various Egyptian tombs. Wood taken from these tombs has been dated using the carbon-14 dating method, and the two dates agree. In addition, the argon/potassium-40 dating method has been used to date the time of the Mount Vesuvius eruption in Italy, and this date coincides with the date reported by Roman historians. Many other corroborative dates have validated the use of radiometric methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dendrochronology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dendrochronology&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is also an absolute dating technique. This science relies on the fact that trees have annual growth rings that reflect the age of the tree – one ring is produced each year. The width of the ring may vary, depending on variations in water and sunlight; a tree ring from a dry year will be more narrow than a tree ring from a year with abundant rainfall. Therefore, the pattern of the rings can also often reveal something about past climate conditions. Remarkably, global fluctuations of weather patterns appear to be the best indicators of annual growth ring changes; growth rings from wood obtained from Egyptian tombs has been matched to tree growth ring patterns found in ancient trees located in California. This figure depicts the basic strategy used to date a piece of wood. Dendrochronology and radiometric dating have been used to date many bristlecone pine trees in the White Mountains of California. The oldest tree has been named Methuselah, and dendrochronology and carbon-14 dating methods have determined the tree to be 4,844 years old. Moreover, by matching tree growth ring patterns with dead wood laying in the vicinity, a tree growth ring catalog has been created that spans back 9,000 years.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Summary</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;This tutorial explored the age of Earth and some techniques for investigating Earth's past. What do we know about events that occurred in Earth's distant past? To answer this question, biology has turned to the sciences of geology, physics, and astronomy to learn about the conditions that existed in Earth's distant past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The available astronomical data indicate that the universe is about 15 billion years old. This estimate is based, in part, on the observation that the universe is constantly expanding. Astronomers have plotted the trajectories of various stars and galaxies and determined that all matter in the known universe arose from a common point. In an event, often referred to as the "Big Bang," the universe arose in a relatively brief moment in time and matter was flung outward from the central origins. Matter has been hurling through space and undergoing a number of changes as it traverses the cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago. It appears that Earth began forming shortly thereafter, and evidence suggests that life first appeared by the end of the first billion years. &amp;nbsp;The available evidence indicates that evolutionary events have been ongoing over the last 3.5 billion years and that these processes have led to the diversity of life we see around us today. In thinking about evolution, remember that all extant (living) species represent "modern" forms of life. The challenge that faces evolutionary biologists is to reconstruct events that have occurred in Earth's distant past, and to infer the nature of ancient events that have contributed to the current diversity of organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most researchers who tackle questions on the origin of life think that organic compounds first formed abiotically. The experiments of Urey and Miller demonstrated that these compounds could have formed in an atmosphere similar to that which existed on early Earth. It is also possible that organic compounds might have formed in deep-sea vents. Another hypothesis, panspermia, is that organic compounds (or perhaps life itself) arrived on the planet from extraterrestrial sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first challenges is to know the temporal sequences of historical events. Fortunately, geologic events provide valuable information. The Earth's crust is not a static structure. It changes as a result of plate tectonics (which leads to continental drift, which is measured at about 1 inch/year, on average), as well as changes in the water levels of the oceans (due to redistributions during one of several ice ages), wind, the successive layering of sediments (material in the oceans sink), and erosion (wind and water pound on the exposed terrestrial ground). The bottoms of these ancient oceans exist in the form of sedimentary rock in many places on the planet. Many extinct species have left their fossilized impressions in these sedimentary layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geologists have studied these layers around the world and have noted common species' patterns of fossils in these various layers. Generally speaking, the deeper the layers, the older the sediment and the more ancient the fossilized species. This relationship is so pervasive that geologists use fossils to describe the layer they are examining. (This has certain practical uses, as geologists looking for oil use the presence of certain fossilized species to know when their drills are approaching oil-bearing strata.) The geological time scale is based on the relative distribution of fossils in sedimentary layers. A close examination of these layers reveals various patterns in the distribution of various fossilized species at different depths (i.e., relative ages). Various changes in the patterns of fossilized species are noted and these are used to delineate four major eras: the Precambrian, the Paleozoic, the Mesozoic, and the Cenozoic. The geological time scale provides a relative time scale, but it does not directly establish an absolute time scale. Atomic physicists can determine absolute time scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matter is composed of subatomic particles. Each atom of a particular element is characterized by the number of protons that exist within its central core. Also, in each core are a variable number of neutrons. Carbon, a prominent atom found in living organisms, has 6 protons. The most prevalent form of carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons and is referred to as carbon-12, or C&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;. However, a much less common form (and one that is unstable) also exists and is known as carbon-14, or C&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;. This unstable form decays at regular intervals. The key here is "regular intervals." It takes about 5730 years for 10 molecules of C&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;to decay into 5 molecules of N&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;. In other words, C&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;has a half-life of about 5730 years. These two isotopes of carbon can be analytically separated and the ratio of the two can provide an absolute dating method for "carbon-dating" a sample. This method's validity has been independently verified using dendrochronology. The carbon-14 dating method is fairly reliable for samples that are less than about 50,000 years old. For samples that are older, or that do not contain carbon, isotopes of other elements can be used. A new method that measures the decay of K&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;into Ar&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;shows great promise in dating samples as young as 2,000 years and as old as several billions years (the half-life of K&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;is 1.25 billion years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dendochronology, the counting of tree rings, cannot go back into deep time; it is limited to determining dates within the past 9000 years.&amp;nbsp; However, it can provide information on climate year by year through examination of the width of these growth rings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life has been evolving on Earth for approximately 3.5 billion years.&amp;nbsp; The three major domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya) are distinguished by fundamental differences in their cell structure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Think Like a Scientist</title>
    <body>&lt;h3&gt;Which technique should you choose?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are reading a blog written by a student who is working at an archeological dig in Cyprus. She mentions that they just uncovered an ancient burial site in which the skeletal remains of a human are found next to those of a cat. The arrangement of the bones suggests that the cat was buried with its owner and may have been a pet. Remarkably, the location of the grave relative to other known artifacts suggests it is 10,000 years old. If this is correct, then this is the earliest evidence for cat domestication. The blog author suggests that dendrochronological analysis of some of the wood fragments found nearby, together with C&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; analysis should confirm the dates. You are not so sure these two methods will work equally well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Which method is most likely to shed accurate insight into the age of these two skeletons? Why?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Which one of these techniques is most reliable?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</body>

    <title>The Diversity of Life</title>
    <body>&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is difficult for us to appreciate exactly how far back life has existed on Earth. One way to look at it is to imagine that all 4.5 billion years of geologic time is compressed into one 24-hour day. During the first second past midnight, earth forms. The origin of life would have occurred around 4:00 am. The oldest fossils known would have been deposited at 5:30 in the morning, just when the sun is coming up. The age of microscopic life starts then and continues all the way past noon, past 3:00, past 6:00, and in fact, it isn't until 9:00 at night that larger organisms appear. All of that evolution that you normally learn about in textbooks, from trilobites to fish to amphibians to reptiles to birds and mammals, all takes place in the last 3 hours of the day. Humans don't appear until just a scant few seconds before midnight." &amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;- J. William Schopf, UCLA paleobiologist&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The Earth has been a living planet for about 4 billion years. During that time, life has evolved and diversified into the approximately 1.8 million species that have been described so far, with the possibility of between 10 and 100 million species living on the planet today. All life on Earth appears to have arisen from a single common ancestor based on the evidence that all organisms studied so far use virtually the same genetic code to transform the information in their DNA into proteins. Life has diversified into three major domains, the&lt;strong&gt; Bacteria&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Archaea&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Eukarya&lt;/strong&gt;. The Bacteria and Archaea have more simple cells (&lt;strong&gt;prokaryotes&lt;/strong&gt;), while member of the Eukarya have complex cells with a nucleus and an array of organelles that perform different functions within the cell (&lt;strong&gt;eukaryotes&lt;/strong&gt;). The figure below shows the relationships among these groups.

    <title>Prokaryotes I - Cellular and Genetic Organization</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Prokaryotes are everywhere. They have been found at the deepest depths of the oceans and high above in the atmosphere. Based on sheer numbers and species diversity, they are the most successful group of life on the planet. A group of studies published in Summer 2012 showed that each human has their own “microbiome” with as many as a thousand different strains of bacteria. Prokaryotes are an essential component of Earth’s ecology, and many human diseases are caused by bacteria, so understanding their biology is important in many different fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial is the first in a three-part series discussing prokaryotes. By the end of this first tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The basic features of all prokaryotes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The diverse lifestyles of prokaryotes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why prokaryotes can undergo rapid evolutionary change&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The basic genetic organization of prokaryotes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How prokaryotes can acquire new genetic information through asexual reproduction&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summarize the major differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the two domains within prokaryotes, including their relationship to eukaryotes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the differences between the archaea and the bacteria&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain how prokaryotes reproduce and exchange genetic information&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discuss the evolutionary consequences of a short generation time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</body>

    <title>Basic Features of Prokaryotes</title>
    <body>&lt;div style="max-width:25em;"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2344|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A defining feature of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;prokaryotes&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is their lack of membrane-bound nuclei. This is not to say they lack subcellular specialization because some prokaryotes have very elaborate internal membranes. However, they generally have less subcellular specialization than&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;eukaryotes &lt;/strong&gt;(organisms with membrane-bound nuclei and organelles). Also, prokaryotes are usually smaller than eukaryotic cells (1-5 microns compared to 10-100 microns). Prokaryotes are often described as being "simple" but this is not an accurate description of the prokaryotes.&amp;nbsp; While they tend to have a more basic structure than eukaryotes, in other ways they are more complex.&amp;nbsp; For example, prokaryotes are capable of more diverse metabolic and nutritional pathways than eukaryotes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prokaryotes are often described as single-celled organisms, but they can form colonies that show a remarkable level of complexity (as depicted in this colorized image of a bacterial colony). The shape of individual cells is used to classify prokaryotes; they can be either spherical (&lt;strong&gt;coccus&lt;/strong&gt;), rod-shaped (&lt;strong&gt;bacillus&lt;/strong&gt;), or helical (&lt;strong&gt;spirillum&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This animation is a simple game to test your understanding of the basic features of a prokaryote.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Prokaryotes by the Numbers</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;In terms of metabolic impact and numbers, prokaryotes dominate the biosphere. They outnumber all eukaryotes combined. They live in a diversity of environments and a teaspoon of common dirt can harbor 100 million or more bacteria. Not only are bacteria plentiful in total numbers, but species diversity is high as well. Although recognizing distinct species of bacteria is a challenge for microbiologists, modern approaches using DNA diversity analysis suggest that new species of bacteria evolve quite rapidly. Recent studies suggest that in that same teaspoon of soil there could reside up to 1 million different species.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ProkaryotesI-CellularandGeneticOrganization-FastGrowth,ReproductionandHighRatesofEvolution"&gt;Fast Growth, Reproduction and High Rates of Evolution
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2350|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]In some cases, prokaryotes can divide in as little as 20 minutes (although much slower rates are also observed). Generally, prokaryotes have three factors that enable them to grow and reproduce rapidly. First, prokaryotes have a small genome (genetic material). Second, prokaryotes have relatively simple structure. Third, prokaryotes reproduce via&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;binary fission&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(cell division in which a prokaryotic chromosome replicates and the mother cell pinches in half to form two new daughter cells) as shown in this figure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binary fission is simply cell division in which two identical offspring each receive a copy of the original, single, parental chromosome. Therefore, binary fission is a type of asexual reproduction (reproduction that does not require the union of two reproductive cells, and that produces offspring genetically identical to the parent cell). A population of rapidly growing prokaryotes can synthesize their DNA almost continuously, which aids in their fast generation times. Even as a cell is physically separating, its DNA can be replicating for the next round of cell division, as seen in the animation on binary fission below.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This simple animation shows binary fission in a prokaryote.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;bacterial-cell-division&gt;&lt;/bacterial-cell-division&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three factors (small genome, simple morphology, and binary fission) allow for a short generation time when compared to eukaryotic cells. This short generation time means that evolutionary changes occur relatively quickly when compared to longer-lived species.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ProkaryotesI-CellularandGeneticOrganization-GeneticOrganizationofProkaryotesAidsFastGenerationTimes"&gt;Genetic Organization of Prokaryotes Aids Fast Generation Times
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to eukaryotes, prokaryotes usually have much smaller genomes. On average, a eukaryotic cell has 1000 times more DNA than a prokaryote. This means that less DNA must be replicated (copied) with each cell division in prokaryotes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DNA in prokaryotes is concentrated in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;nucleoid&lt;/strong&gt;. The prokaryotic chromosome is typically a double-stranded DNA molecule that is arranged in a single large ring. What shape are eukaryotic chromosomes?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prokaryotes often have smaller rings of extrachromosomal DNA termed&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;plasmids&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(these are also found in a few eukaryotes). Most plasmids consist of only a few genes. Plasmids are not required for survival in most environments because the prokaryotic chromosome programs all of the cell's essential functions. However, plasmids may contain genes that provide resistance to antibiotics, metabolism of unusual nutrients, plasmids that confer virulence, and other special functions. Plasmids replicate independently of the main chromosome, and many can be readily transferred between prokaryotic cells.

    <title>The Horizontal Transfer of Genetic Information Between Prokaryotes </title>
    <body>&lt;p id="ProkaryotesI-CellularandGeneticOrganization-AsexualReproductionandtheTransferofGeneticInformationBetweenProkaryotes"&gt;Prokaryotes do not alternate between the haploid and diploid states, so meiosis and fertilization are not found in the prokaryote life cycle. Rather, binary fission is the main method of reproduction in prokaryotes. This form of asexual reproduction means that the genetic variation created by meiosis and random fertilization does not occur in prokaryotes. Nonetheless, genetic variation does occur in prokaryotes, and mutations are one source of variation in a population. Genetic variation within a population can be beneficial because it provides the raw materials for a population to adapt to a changing environment. Greater diversity in the gene pool increases the likelihood that at least some of the organisms in a population will have the right genetic combination to survive if environmental conditions change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will discuss three ways in which prokaryotes transfer genes between individuals (transformation, conjugation, and transduction).&amp;nbsp; All three of these gene transfer mechanisms are collectively referred to as &lt;strong&gt;horizontal gene transfer&lt;/strong&gt; to differential them from the vertical gene transfer typical of most eukaryotes in which genes are only passed from parent to offspring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ProkaryotesI-CellularandGeneticOrganization-Transformation"&gt;Transformation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way that genetic material can be moved between bacteria is&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;transformation&lt;/strong&gt;. Transformation occurs when prokaryotes acquire genes from their surrounding environment. This DNA might have been left behind by other bacteria (from the same or different species) when they died. The foreign DNA is directly taken up by the cell and expressed. If the DNA contains a beneficial gene (e.g., one encoding for antibiotic resistance), then the individuals harboring that gene will have a selective advantage over their non-transformed counterparts. As long as individuals with this gene reproduce more successfully, compared to those lacking the gene, they will be more fit and the gene will increase in frequency (i.e., microevolution, via natural selection, will occur).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other examples include transformation of nonpathogenic bacteria into&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;pathogenic&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(harmful) strains. When harmless&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;bacteria are placed in a medium containing dead cells of the pathogenic strain, they can take up the DNA from the dead pathogenic cells. If the formerly harmless bacteria pick up the gene for pathogenicity, they will become pathogenic themselves. It is important to point out that pathogenicity may not confer a long-term increase in fitness; if the host dies, the microsymbiont has lost its' "home". As such, it is often said that the "smartest" pathogens are those that cause the lowest mortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ProkaryotesI-CellularandGeneticOrganization-Conjugation"&gt;Conjugation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic material can also move between bacteria by&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;conjugation&lt;/strong&gt;. The mechanism of conjugation requires that two living prokaryotic cells physically join with one another. Typically DNA transfer only goes one way, with the "male" using an appendage called a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;pilus&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(plural, pili). In order to produce pili, prokaryotes must have a plasmid termed the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;F factor&lt;/strong&gt;(fertility factor plasmid). When a cell has the F factor plasmid, it is said to be F+. This F+ condition is heritable. If an F+ cell divides, both of the resulting cells will be F+. This condition is also "contagious." After an F+ cell conjugates with a "female" cell that does not contain the F factor, the "female" cell obtains the F factor plasmid and becomes F+ ("male").&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="ProkaryotesI-CellularandGeneticOrganization-Transduction"&gt;Transduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic material can also be moved between bacteria by&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;transduction&lt;/strong&gt;. In this event, the exchange of DNA between prokaryotes is made possible by&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;phages&lt;/strong&gt;(viruses that infect bacteria). Phages reproduce by injecting their genetic material inside the bacterial cell, then multiplying, and eventually bursting from the cell. In transduction, the phage DNA inserts somewhat benignly into the bacterial host chromosome. Here it can lay dormant for many generations. However, under certain conditions, the phage DNA removes (excises) itself from the bacterial chromosome (usually carrying pieces of the chromosome with it), then replicates and forms new phages that burst out of the cell. These phages can reinfect other bacteria and thereby transfer not only their own DNA, but pieces of the former host DNA into the newly infected bacterium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="ProkaryotesI-CellularandGeneticOrganization-GeneticVariationandEvolution"&gt;Genetic Variation and Evolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short generation time associated with binary fission was pointed out earlier in this tutorial. We also know that mutations add new and different alleles to populations. These two factors (short generation times and mutations), combined with the processes of conjugation and transduction, help prokaryotic populations achieve vast genetic variation (without the alternation of haploid/diploid states seen in many eukaryotes). Generation times are minutes to hours, and can result in a beneficial mutation being heavily favored and passed on to a great number of offspring in a very short period of time. Once again, a short generation span enables prokaryotic populations to adapt very rapidly to environmental change. This adaptive evolution is as important now to prokaryotes as it was when prokaryotic life began to diversify a few billion years ago.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Summary</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;This tutorial introduced you to the prokaryotes. They are a very diverse group of organisms that are commonly referred to as bacteria; however, they are really comprised of two different domains. One domain, the Archaea, usually grow in the most extreme environments. Their ability to occupy extreme habitats is mirrored by their flexibility in utilizing resources; some species can use metals as an energy source, whereas others can live on oil or hydrogen sulfide. The other prokaryotic domain, the Bacteria, is much more abundant. Although diverse, members of both domains share some common features. Prokaryotes lack membrane-bound nuclei, they are generally single-celled or colonial, and they are very small. The genetic organization of prokaryotes and binary fission as a means for replication aids in their fast generation times, which contributes to relatively quick evolutionary changes. We will continue our discussion of prokaryotes in the next tutorial by exploring their metabolism, structure and function.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Classification</title>
    <body>&lt;p id="ProkaryotesI-CellularandGeneticOrganization-Classification"&gt;In the last few decades, several taxonomic schemes have been used to classify the world's organisms. One of the simplest divides life into prokaryotes and eukaryotes; that is, those organisms without nuclei went into one group and those with nuclei went into another, respectively. Another commonly used scheme divides life into five kingdoms: Monera (prokaryotes), Protista, Plantae, Fungi, and Animalia. You may see one of these schemes in an older textbook or website. Keep in mind that classification schemes strive to show the evolutionary relationships between groups, and in recent years it has become apparent that the evolutionary relationships of prokaryotes are quite complex. One prokaryotic group, the Archaea, have some features that are more eukaryotic-like than prokaryotic-like. Although the Archaea lack a nucleus, their genetic organization is, in several important ways, more like that of a eukaryote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2986|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reconcile new data, the taxonomic scheme of life has been revised. The most current scheme proposes that life be divided into three domains. In this scheme prokaryotic organisms can belong to the domain&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Archaea&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;or the domain&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Bacteria&lt;/strong&gt;, while those organisms that have a nucleus comprise the third domain,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Eukarya&lt;/strong&gt;. Organisms that belong to each of these three domains are sometimes referred to as the archaebacteria, eubacteria and eukaryotes, respectively. This figure illustrates the relationship among the three domains. Keep in mind that the last universal common ancestor (&lt;strong&gt;LUCA&lt;/strong&gt;) of life on earth most likely arose over 3.5 billion years ago. This organism probably had a fairly complex cell&amp;nbsp;structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2348|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archaea are sometimes referred to as&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;extremophiles&lt;/strong&gt;, and many species live in extreme environments (e.g., hot springs, salt ponds, Arctic ice, deep oil wells, acidic ponds that form near mines, and hydrothermal vents); however, these environments are not extreme to those archaea. In fact, many extremophiles die when moved to our more temperate environment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The archaea have several features that distinguish them from the bacteria.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; First, the archaea do not have the compound&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;peptidoglycan&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;associated with their cell membranes. Peptidoglycan is a polymer of sugars and amino acids that is unique to the bacteria.&amp;nbsp; Secondly, the archaea have&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;introns&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;in some of their genes.&amp;nbsp; Introns are intervening or non-coding sequences of DNA that are found in some archaea genes and the genes of eukaryotes (in contrast, &lt;strong&gt;exons&lt;/strong&gt; are&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;segments of a DNA or RNA molecule containing information that codes for a protein).&lt;/span&gt; Bacteria do not have introns. Thirdly, members of the archaea have unique lipids associated with their cell membranes (we will not focus on the characteristics of these lipids).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Real Life Example:  Evolution in a Prokaryote</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;In the "Real Life Example" in the tutorial "Life and Natural Selection", you were introduced to the Evolution Canyons in Israel (review this example from&amp;nbsp; the tutorial if you do not recall the information). Researchers are interested in a variety of organisms’ responses to the extreme environmental differences between the south-facing (“African”) and north-facing (“European”) slopes of the Evolution Canyons.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;
  &lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2264|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2266|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One team of researchers is looking at evolutionary responses in a common soil bacterium&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;in the Evolutionary Canyons.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;B. subtilis&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a good choice of organism for this research because it is a common model organism that has been used to study prokaryote genetics and the process of DNA replication in prokaryotes in laboratory settings and thus a great deal is already known about the organisms’ genetics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the team’s research findings include that the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;B. subtilis&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;that live on the south-facing slopes are more efficient at producing biological molecules (“biosynthesis”) than those that live on the north-facing slope (Nevo, 2009).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Based on the genus name (&lt;em&gt;Bacillus&lt;/em&gt;), what shape is this bacterium? Is it a member of domain Archaea or domain Bacteria?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is a model organism (you will need to look this up in an outside source)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop a plausible hypothesis for why bacteria living on the south-facing slopes have more efficient biosynthesis than those living on the north-facing slopes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This&amp;nbsp;is a magnification of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Vibrio cholerae&lt;/em&gt;, the organism responsible for cholera. Note the tail-like flagellum on one end; many prokaryotes are propelled by rotating flagella. The cellular and genetic organization of prokaryotes was introduced in our last tutorial. Recall that we also introduced their morphologies by discussing three basic shape categories of prokaryotes: cocci, bacilli, and spirilla. We will continue our discussion by exploring their metabolism, structure and movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prokaryotic cell structure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prokaryotic movement and responses to the environment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The different nutritional modes of prokaryotes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The diversity of prokaryotic carbon sources&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bioremediation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diagram the structure of bacterial cell walls and describe how this relates to virulence&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify the nutritional modes seen in prokaryotes and the sources of carbon that they can use&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the structure of the prokaryotic flagella&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discuss the different types of taxis and why this response is important&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain the advantage of sporulation to prokaryotes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>The Prokaryotic Cell Wall and Peptidoglycan</title>
    <body>&lt;p id="ProkaryotesII-StructureandFunction-TheProkaryoticCellWallandPeptidoglycan"&gt;The cells of all organisms (including prokaryotes) are encased in a plasma membrane, which consists of a phospholipid bilayer that is selectively permeable. This bilayer keeps salts and liquids in balance inside the cell by engulfing needed particles and ridding the cell of wastes. In addition to a plasma membrane, many organisms (including plants, fungi, and some protists) also have cell walls. These walls are involved in maintaining cell shape and protection.&amp;nbsp; Most prokaryotes have cell walls, but they are structurally different than those of the plants, fungi, and protists (Archaea have unique molecules in their cell walls and cell membranes that we won’t discuss here).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2356|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gram's stain is used to differentiate bacteria, based upon the amount of peptidoglycan in their cell walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cell walls of Bacteria contain some amount of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;peptidoglycan&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a polymer consisting of sugar and polypeptides. If one were attempting to identify bacteria, one might first examine them under a microscope to detect whether the specimens were rod-shaped, round, or spiral. Then one might analyze the amount of peptidoglycan in the cell walls of the unknown organisms by using a technique known as&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Gram's stain&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacteria containing a lot of peptidoglycan in their cell walls also tend to have less complex cell walls, and are called&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;gram-positive&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;bacteria. Conversely,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;gram-negative&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;bacteria have less peptidoglycan, but have more complex cell walls overall. In particular, the gram-negative bacteria have an additional outer membrane with attached&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;lipopolysaccharides&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these lipopolysaccharides are toxic, serving to counteract the natural defenses of the host organism. Also, the additional membrane of gram-negative bacteria can make them more resistant to antibacterial medications (&lt;strong&gt;antibiotics&lt;/strong&gt;). For these two reasons, a gram-negative bacterial infection can be far more severe than a gram-positive infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ProkaryotesII-StructureandFunction-TheCapsuleandPilus"&gt;The Capsule and Pilus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerous adaptations have evolved in host organisms to fight bacterial infections, and the numerous counter adaptations by bacteria to evade these adaptive defenses, have resulted in bacteria that are skilled at survival in inhospitable conditions. In addition to cell walls and cell membranes, many bacteria have an additional layer outside the cell wall termed the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;capsule&lt;/strong&gt;. Capsules are sticky substances made and secreted by a bacterium, and they help bacteria adhere to surfaces or to each other. Capsules also provide an additional layer of protection to the encapsulated organism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall from the last tutorial that pili can provide an avenue for exchange of genetic information. Some prokaryotes also use these surface appendages for attachment to a variety of substrates. For example,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Neisseria gonorrhoeae &lt;/em&gt;attaches to the epithelium within the reproductive tract via pili, where they can inflict individuals with the sexually transmitted disease (STD) that carries the species name. Mutant strains that lack pili are nonpathogenic.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Nutritional Modes of Prokaryotes</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;During the course of evolution, prokaryotes have adapted to a myriad of environments. Part of this adaptation involves different ways of obtaining energy and carbon. In looking at the diversity of prokaryotes, one observes many different nutritional modes. When considering nutritional modes, there are some general features that are commonly used to categorize the nutritional state of any organism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All life can be categorized nutritionally according to how an organism obtains its energy and from where it gets its carbon. The prefixes "chemo" and "photo" are used to describe whether the energy comes from a high-energy molecule (e.g., glucose) or from light, respectively. "Auto" and "hetero" are used to describe whether carbon dioxide or a more complex form of carbon is used as a carbon source, respectively. The prefixes are then affixed to the suffix "troph," meaning nourishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ProkaryotesII-StructureandFunction-DiversityofCarbonSources"&gt;Diversity of Carbon Sources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prokaryotes can use carbon in a variety of forms, both as an energy source and as a precursor for anabolic reactions. As you've learned, carbon dioxide is the simplest form of carbon used. Organisms that use this simple form of carbon are often called "carbon fixers".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2364|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]Most prokaryotes use sugars (monosaccharides and disaccharides) and complex carbohydrates (e.g., starch) as a carbon source. However, very unusual forms of carbon can also be used by some prokaryotes. For example, some prokaryotes can feed on oil. Although a bane to the oil fields, these oil-eating bacteria have been used to help clean up oil spills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some bacteria are capable of using synthetically produced carbon compounds such as TNT (used as an industrial and military explosive) and PCBs (banned substances which are persistent organic pollutants in the environment) as a carbon source. These bacteria metabolize these compounds and produce nontoxic by-products. Humans have exploited this ability by using various species of bacteria for the removal of toxins from the environment; a process known as&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;bioremediation.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;There is an emerging field of civil engineering that utilizes bacteria (along with other eukaryotic microorganisms) for the purpose of cleaning contaminated soils, wells, and river sediments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=1994|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil tanker the &lt;em&gt;Exxon Valdez&lt;/em&gt; ran aground in Alaska's Prince William Sound in the spring of 1989, dumping approximately 11-million gallons of oil. &amp;nbsp; Naturally occurring oil degrading microorganisms played a role in reducing the overall environmental impact of this accident.&amp;nbsp; Bioremediation efforts were used in the &lt;em&gt;Exxon Valdez&lt;/em&gt; spill; these efforts included adding fertilizers containing nitrogen to speed up the rates of oil degradation. In 2010, the BP &lt;em&gt;Deepwater Horizon&lt;/em&gt; well experienced a leak which led to an explosion that killed 11 people and caused the largest oil spill in U.S. history with an estimated 210-million gallons of oil released into the environment.&amp;nbsp; As with the &lt;em&gt;Exxon Valdez&lt;/em&gt;, microorganisms in the environment helped to degrade the oil (although due to the different nature of the spill - fertilizers were not useful in the &lt;em&gt;Deepwater Horizon&lt;/em&gt; spill).&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Photo source: Office of Response and Restoration, National Ocean Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="450" src="https://voicethread.com/app/player/?threadId=2128111" width="800"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

    <title>The Sporulation Advantage</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2366|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]By now you should understand why bacteria dominate the globe. They divide rapidly, produce toxins, live just about anywhere, and are metabolically diverse. In addition, some bacteria can adopt an alternative form that allows them to survive extreme conditions. More specifically, many bacteria are able to form&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;endospores&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(thickly coated, resistant cells) during harsh conditions (see image). Typically,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;sporulation&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(the formation of endospores) is triggered by a decline in key nutrients in the environment surrounding the bacteria. Some endospores can survive drying, freezing, or boiling. For this reason, it is not always sufficient to boil water to destroy all bacteria, necessitating the use of higher pressures and temperatures in an autoclave (a pressurized chamber used to sterilize laboratory equipment and other materials).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Bacillus&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is able to form endospores (boxed area in photograph) that are resistant to harsh conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Summary</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;This tutorial continued our discussion of prokaryotes by introducing their cell walls, various means of locomotion, and nutritional modes. Prokaryotes have a number of modifications to their walls. The gram-positive bacteria have walls rich in peptidoglycans (a class of molecule derived from sugars and proteins). Gram-negative bacteria have a double-walled character and do not have a great deal of peptidoglycans (which is why they do not stain well with Gram's stain). On the other hand, the gram-negative bacteria are often rich in lipopolysaccharides (a class of molecules derived from lipids and sugars), which can be toxic to other life forms; many bacterial toxins belong to this class of molecules. An additional sticky capsule (and/or pili) may be present, which help some bacteria adhere to various substrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to modifications to their walls, a variety of prokaryotes have the capability of moving about their environment. This movement is not random, but rather, can be governed by the presence of various molecules in the environment. Some bacteria can detect the presence of nutrients, and they move toward a high concentration of a particular carbon source in a process generally referred to as chemotaxis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial presented the diversity of prokaryotic nutritional modes and carbon sources. Bacteria can use simple sugars, as well as complex sources of carbon. Some bacteria can live off oil, and some can decompose cellulose. The ability to breakdown complex carbon sources has been utilized for a variety of purposes. The field of bioremediation is based, to a large extent, on the use of bacteria that can breakdown harmful compounds that have been introduced into the environment from various industrial and agricultural sources. For example, bacteria are capable of breaking down TNT and PCBs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most prokaryotes are very sensitive to their environment and can alter their behavior in response to changing conditions. For example, most species of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Bacillus&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;can form hardy spores in response to stressful conditions. These spores have low metabolic activity, can survive extreme conditions (e.g., boiling water) and are long-lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next tutorial will discuss the ecological significance of various types of prokaryotes and the evolution of this group.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>How do Prokaryotes Get Around?</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Many prokaryotes are capable of directional movement, and some can actually move quite quickly, up to 100 times their body length in one second. (Think about this in terms of human movement; if a running person has a six-foot stride, this translates to over 400 miles per hour!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some prokaryotes can secrete slimy chemicals and then glide around on them. Some helical bacteria, the spirochetes, have internal filaments that are arranged so that the whole organism rotates axially; because the organism is helical in shape, the resulting movement is similar to the action of a corkscrew. The most common type of movement in prokaryotes is through flagellar action. A&amp;nbsp;flagellum&amp;nbsp;(plural, flagella) is a long appendage specialized for locomotion, and while both eukaryotes and prokaryotes may exhibit flagellar motion, the flagella of prokaryotes are different structurally from those of eukaryotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2362|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacterial flagella can rotate either clockwise or counterclockwise. When rotating clockwise, the flagella fly apart, causing the bacteria to tumble randomly. When rotating counterclockwise, the flagella are drawn together into a bundle that results in directional movement. Bacteria with flagella alternate between tumbling and directional movement. In some cases the movement is random, but in other cases there is an oriented movement (&lt;strong&gt;taxis&lt;/strong&gt;) toward or away from a stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2360|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prokaryotes (and eukaryotes) that exhibit taxis typically respond to some environmental cue. If the cue is a chemical, such as a carbon source, then the organism typically responds in a positive manner and moves toward the source in a response referred to as positive chemotaxis. Conversely, if the chemical is noxious, then the organism typically responds in a negative manner and moves away from the source in a process known as negative chemotaxis. Other environmental cues are also used (e.g., light, gravity, and magnetism). What type of taxis is a motile bacterium&amp;nbsp; displaying when it moves toward light?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="450" src="https://voicethread.com/app/player/?threadId=2128487" width="800"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

    <title>A Real Life Example:  Clostridium botulinum and the botulism toxin</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2368|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bacterium&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Clostridium botulinum&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;produces one of the most potent human toxins known – the botulism toxin. This toxin has the effect of inhibiting the neurotransmitter acetylcholine which is required for a nerve to stimulate a muscle. As a result, a person who has ingested the botulism toxin suffers from flaccid paralysis which can lead to death. (Cosmetic surgeons have taken advantage of the actions of this toxin to use in the control of wrinkles. The toxin, at low concentrations, interferes with the underlying muscles' ability to contract which smoothes out wrinkles, particularly between the eyes and on the forehead).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clostridium botulinum&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is an anaerobic gram positive bacterium. The actively growing cells are intolerant of oxygen (in other words, exposure to too much oxygen is lethal to these bacteria) but they can form resistant spores that withstand exposure to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Sporulation can only occur in anaerobic environments and the neurotoxin is only produced during sporulation.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;This bacterium is widely distributed in soil, sediments of lakes and ponds, and decaying vegetation. Illness and death due to&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Clostridium&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is not due to an infection but rather intoxication as a result of consuming the toxin (the bacterium itself does not cause illness but the neurotoxin it produces does).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, one of the most common routes of exposure to the botulism toxin is due to the consumption of improperly canned foods. Some people have expressed concern that&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Clostridium&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;botulinum&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;could be used in a terrorist attack.What advantage does sporulation provide the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Clostridium botulinum&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;bacterium?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What conditions are necessary for a canned food product to become tainted with botulism?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How is botulism poisoning prevented?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why would a large scale release of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Clostridium botulinum&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;be an ineffective way to poison a large number of people?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</body>

    <title>Prokaryotes III - Evolution and Early Metabolism</title>
    <body>&lt;h3 id="ProkaryotesIII-EvolutionandEarlyMetabolism-IntroductionandLearningObjectives"&gt;Introduction and Learning Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last two tutorials discussed the diversity of prokaryotes, their structure, and their diverse metabolisms. Prokaryotes can use a variety of nitrogen and carbon sources, and in doing so they are important members of the biosphere. Prokaryotes also are involved in important relationships with many other types of organisms. After working through this tutorial you should understand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How bacteria can be beneficial&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Symbiotic relationships between prokaryotes and other life forms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nitrogen use and the prokaryote&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oxygen and metabolic relationships&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Origins of metabolic processes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance Objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Categorize the different types of relationships seen among organisms and be able to cite examples of each type in the bacteria&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the impact of prokaryotes on the environment of the early Earth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</body>

    <title>Interactions of Prokaryotes with Other Organisms</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;From some of the examples in the previous tutorials, you might have concluded that most bacteria are pathogens that cause diseases. However, this generalization is wrong. In fact, the vast majority of bacteria around us are either essential or harmless to the life of other organisms (including ourselves). Humans are covered with bacteria (both inside and out). You may find this fact unsettling, but right now there are approximately 400 different species of bacteria living in your gastrointestinal system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a relatively small percentage of the bacterial species that colonize us (and all other multicellular organisms) are pathogenic. The vast majority of bacteria are ecologically significant and beneficial. In most instances, bacteria colonize on and live harmlessly with other species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state of any two species having an extended and intimate association is termed&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;symbiosis&lt;/strong&gt;. You might have heard other definitions for this term, but researchers in the field agree that this is the best definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ProkaryotesIII-EvolutionandEarlyMetabolism-TypesofSymbioses"&gt;Types of Symbioses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interacting organisms (symbionts) have varying relationships with one another. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;host&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(the larger of two species) and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;microsymbiont&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(the smaller of the two species) may derive mutual benefit from the association, in which case the symbiosis is termed&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;mutualism&lt;/strong&gt;. At the other end of the symbiotic spectrum is a relationship whereby one member of the symbiosis derives benefit at the expense of the other, which is termed&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;parasitism&lt;/strong&gt;. In the middle of this spectrum are associations which appear benign (are neither of benefit nor harm) to either or both species; this form of symbiosis is termed&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;commensalism&lt;/strong&gt;. These are not fixed relationships, and the association between the symbionts is not constant and can change, depending on conditions. For example, a relationship may be commensalistic (or even mutualistic) most of the time, but under certain conditions the association can turn parasitic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2370|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symbiosis is not a static process. Commensalistic or mutualistic relationships can quickly change to parasitic relationships depending on environmental conditions. For instance, the bacteria in your intestines play an important role in processing food into absorbable nutrients. This symbiotic relationship is mutualistic, but a punctured intestine can release the bacteria into other parts of the body where they can quickly induce sepsis, an often fatal condition. This sort of event is known as an&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;opportunistic infection&lt;/strong&gt;, where a normally commensalistic bacteria becomes pathogenic in response to a changed environment (usually a weakened immune system). Penn State’s Center for Sports Surface Research has examined the role of synthetic turf in staph infections. View their video below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v5RwHr81E1w" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this a concern?&amp;nbsp; Did their study provide evidence that synthetic turf increases the risk of staph infections in athletes?&amp;nbsp; Was there a difference between the survival of staph on outdoor versus indoor synthetic turf?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Symbiotic Relationships in Prokaryotes</title>
    <body>&lt;h3&gt;Mutualism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite a few mutualistic symbioses involving prokaryotes are known, but unfortunately they don't get nearly the attention they deserve. Without their existence, however, life as we know it would not exist. Let's consider a few examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen is essential to all life. It is required for the synthesis of nucleic acids, proteins, and a host of other important biomolecules. However, without the action of certain prokaryotes, little nitrogen would be available to the biosphere. There are several species of bacteria that can convert atmospheric nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) into a form (e.g., ammonium) that can be used by other life. One of the most important groups are those bacteria that form a symbiosis with certain plants. For example, &lt;em&gt;Rhizobium&lt;/em&gt; bacteria colonize on the roots of pea plants, where they fix nitrogen. The plant provides carbon to the bacteria, and the bacteria provide nitrogen to the plant; a classic and extremely important example of a mutualistic symbiosis. We will discuss this further in the section on the Nitrogen Cycle below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans serve as a host for a number of mutualistic symbioses with prokaryotes. Researchers have studied these to varying degrees. For example, one (or more) of the bacteria species that colonize our lower gastrointestinal tract has the ability to synthesize vitamin K (which humans cannot produce). Vitamin K is taken up by your intestines and used in blood-clotting (and possibly other reactions). In this symbiosis, humans get an essential vitamin and the bacteria get a source of carbon from the food we do not completely digest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ProkaryotesIII-EvolutionandEarlyMetabolism-Parasitism"&gt;Parasitism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2372|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a parasitic symbiosis, one member of the symbiosis benefits at the expense of another. Parasitic bacteria that cause disease in their hosts are called pathogens. These pathogenic bacteria cause disease by either invading healthy host tissue or by producing toxins that poison the host.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Exotoxins&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;are proteins secreted by prokaryotes, whereas&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;endotoxins&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;are surface protein components of the outer cell membrane in some gram-negative bacteria.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Clostridium botulinum&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(the causative agent of botulism) is a notorious exotoxin-secretor, as is&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Vibrio cholerae&lt;/em&gt;, which causes cholera. The causative agent of typhoid fever,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Salmonella typhi&lt;/em&gt;, produces endotoxins that counteract the human host's natural defenses.Commensalism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="_Tgc"&gt;Commensalism is defined as a relationship between two organisms in which one benefits and the other is neither harmed nor helped.&amp;nbsp; Many of the bacteria living on the surface of your skin are an e&lt;/span&gt;xample of commensalism.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Body As a Biological Community</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Remember that our own bodies are teeming with bacteria, as are virtually all eukaryotes. At birth we were devoid of bacteria, but as we acquired bacteria through feeding, and simply by being around other humans and the environment, our bodies became colonized with hundreds of different species of bacteria. The relative proportions of these species are variable. However, some of our commensalistic bacteria can become parasitic when our natural defense mechanisms become depressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2374|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Summer 2012, research groups published major findings from the Human Microbiome Project; the genetic material of bacteria taken from 242 healthy people was sequenced by a team of 200 scientists from 80 different institutions.&amp;nbsp; They found that each person had about 1000 different strains of bacteria living on or in their bodies (two to five pounds!), and that this “&lt;strong&gt;microbiome&lt;/strong&gt;” was different for each person. All individuals had some disease-causing bacteria in their microbiome, but it was not causing disease. They also discovered that babies born via a C-section had different microbiomes than babies born vaginally. As a scientist, what would you do to follow up on this finding?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relationship between host and symbiont can be quite complex. Termites are a good example of this complexity. We normally think of these insects as wood eaters, and indeed they can dine on our homes. However, they themselves cannot directly digest the wood. Inside the termite gut is a menagerie of protists (to be discussed in future tutorials) that ingest the wood particles consumed by the termite. But even these protists cannot directly digest the cellulose. Rather, living in and around the protozoa are bacteria that can degrade the wood. So it is the microsymbiont living within the microsymbiont of the termite host that actually degrades the wood. Life is interrelated in surprising ways.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>A Real Life Example:  Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and the human gut</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2388|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]The adult human intestine is home to up to 100 trillion bacteria (this is 10x the number of cells that make up an adult human).&amp;nbsp; It has been suggested that the human intestine achieves the highest cell densities of any ecosystem on earth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Recently we have discovered that the presence of these bacteria gives us metabolic capacities that we have not evolved for ourselves.&amp;nbsp; For example,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is very good at digesting polysaccharides that we find indigestible.&amp;nbsp; By breaking down these polysaccharides, they produce smaller compounds that our bodies can use for nutrients and energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;When&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;escapes the gut, it can cause infections and abscesses in many parts of the body.&amp;nbsp; Infection from&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is an important side effect of abdominal surgeries and populations of the bacteria are almost universally resistant to penicillin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Our symbiotic relationship with many of these gut bacteria has traditionally been referred to as commensalism.&amp;nbsp; Our recent findings, however, suggest this is not correct and we need to update our understanding of our symbiotic relationships with our gut bacteria, including&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Summary</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;A great deal of life on the planet depends on prokaryotes, either directly or indirectly. Many prokaryotes form intimate associations with other species. These symbiotic relationships can take on a variety of forms. At one extreme are the mutualistic relationships. In a mutualistic symbiosis, both species derive benefit from the association; the bacteria that live in our lower digestive tract provide us with a number of vitamins and, in turn, we provide them with a source of carbon from the food we do not digest ourselves. At the other extreme is a parasitic symbiosis, in which the symbiont benefits at the expense of the host. Such parasitic bacteria are usually termed pathogenic because they can cause serious diseases. Microbiologists have provided us with an appreciation for prokaryotes, and their discoveries have led to new opportunities for using prokaryotes to better humanity and to combat diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prokaryotes are an important component of ecosystems. The saprophytes degrade material from dead organic matter, and in doing so make nitrogen and carbon available to other life forms. Without them, nutrients would quickly be tied up in the carcasses of dead organisms and unavailable for other organisms in the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen is necessary for the synthesis of amino acids. As with carbon, bacteria obtain their nitrogen from various sources. Some bacteria can convert ammonia into a more useful form of nitrogen (like nitrates and nitrites). Saprophytic bacteria obtain their nitrogen from decaying organic matter, whereas nitrogen-fixing bacteria obtain their nitrogen from molecular nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) found in the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyanobacteria not only fix their own nitrogen from the air, but they also synthesize their own sugars from carbon dioxide, using sunlight as an energy source. They may be the most efficient form of life on the planet. Indeed, the ancestors of blue-green algae played an important role in the history of the planet because their photosynthetic activity converted our planet's early anaerobic environment into one that is oxygen rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also examined the relationships between oxygen and metabolism, and &amp;nbsp;later in the course we will explore, in more detail, the relationship between energy and metabolic processes.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>A Real Life Example:  Growing plants in disease-suppressive soil</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;It has long been recognized that some soils are disease-suppressive soils – that is they have the ability to suppress the occurrence of soil-borne plant diseases caused by soil microorganisms.&amp;nbsp; The mechanisms by which this disease-suppression is brought about have been the subject of study.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The soil layer surrounding plant roots (the rhizospere) is a complex community in which a diversity of microorganisms (archaea, bacteria, and fungi) and plants interact with one another. If plants are parasitized by fungal or bacterial pathogens, it is thought that soil from the rhizosphere may protect plants from future attacks. &amp;nbsp;This disease-suppression is thought to be the result of a mutualism between the plants that provide nutrients for microorganisms while the microorganisms protect the plant from parasitism by other soil organisms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to better understand disease-suppressive soils, researchers investigated whether microorganisms were responsible for the protective effects of these soils. Disease-suppressive soil was obtained from an agricultural field in the Netherlands in which sugar beet crops had previously been attacked by a fungal pathogen, &lt;em&gt;Rhizoctonia solani&lt;/em&gt;. Other soil was collected from the margin of the field. The researchers predicted that soil from the margin would not offer protection against pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2934|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2935|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers then planted and raised sugar beets in greenhouses, using 5 different soil treatments. Each soil treatment was applied to 4 pots, and each pot contained 8 plants. The pots were inoculated with &lt;i&gt;Rhizoctonia solani&lt;/i&gt; and placed in greenhouses kept at 20°C with a 16-hour light: 8-hour dark cycle. After 20 days, researchers determined the percentage of infected sugar beet seedlings for each soil treatment. The results of the experiment are shown in the table.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Global Impact of Prokaryotes and the Nitrogen Cycle</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen is found in all proteins and nucleic acids, hence it is essential to all forms of life. This atom is abundant in the air around us in the form of atmospheric nitrogen. However, nitrogen availability is a problem because nitrogen, in its elemental form (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;gas), is not usable by most organisms. Nitrogen can only be transformed into a biologically usable state (i.e., "fixed") by certain nitrogen-fixing bacteria, in a process termed&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;nitrogen fixation&lt;/strong&gt;. "Nitrogen-fixers" live in the aquatic environment, the soil, and in or around the roots and stems of certain species of plants.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen gas (also known as dinitrogen or N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is converted to ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) by nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The fixed nitrogen is then used by plants (and other soil- and aquatic-dwelling microorganisms) in various anabolic pathways leading to the synthesis of proteins, nucleic acids, and other nitrogenous molecules.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3005|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
  &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;&lt;!--td {
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
  }
    br {
      mso-data-placement:same-cell;
    }
    --&gt;
  &lt;/style&gt;
  Bacteria, housed in these root nodules, fix nitrogen for this soybean plant.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plants, the primary energy producers in the terrestrial environment, are a major repository for fixed nitrogen in the terrestrial biosphere. When a plant is eaten, the herbivore obtains nitrogen in the form of proteins and nucleic acids (which are broken down during digestion and used by the herbivore for the production of its own nitrogen products). When a plant dies, a variety of organisms known as "decomposers" also obtain nitrogen from the nitrogenous compounds previously made by the plant. Finally, fixed nitrogen can be reconverted by soil bacteria back into atmospheric nitrogen. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;nitrogen cycle&lt;/strong&gt; is essential for all life on the planet. The previous tutorial briefly introduced the symbiosis that leads to nitrogen fixation. We will now examine this symbiosis in more detail.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Nitrogen Fixers
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;
  &lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2380|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2382|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all&amp;nbsp;legumes&amp;nbsp;(e.g., peas, alfalfa, and soybeans) are capable of housing nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The plant-prokaryote mutualism (the plant gets fixed nitrogen from the bacteria, while the bacteria get carbon from the plant) that results is determined by a complex series of events that begins with chemical communication between the participating organisms. Plants that participate in these symbioses secrete molecules (e.g., flavonoids) that act as chemical signals to a select species of bacteria. The term&amp;nbsp;rhizobia&amp;nbsp;is applied to several species of bacteria that participate in these symbioses. The targeted rhizobia are induced to respond when the specific chemical signal stimulates specific genes to "turn on." Bacteria then migrate toward the plant's root. Once bacteria reach the root, a developmental change is induced in the root, which results in&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;nodule&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;formation. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Rhizobium&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;bacteria take up residence inside the nodule. Thus, the events of nodule formation involve chemical cross-signaling between the two participants. The environment of the plant-derived nodule is favorable for the fixation of nitrogen by the bacteria that live inside.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2384|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]In addition to rhizobia/legume symbioses, several other symbiotic nitrogen-fixing symbioses are known. For example, various species of cyanobacteria&amp;nbsp;(often referred to as blue-green algae) are capable of nitrogen fixation. One symbiosis is particularly important to humanity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Anabaena&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a Cyanobacterium genus that colonizes on the leaves of an aquatic fern that grows in rice paddies; the symbiosis supplies nitrogen to the pond, where it subsequently is taken up and used by rice plants. About 75% of all rice is cultivated in flooded fields, and this symbiosis has allowed rice farmers to maintain high levels of productivity without the need for expensive chemical fertilizers.

    <title>The Global Impact of Prokaryotes and Oxygen</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;It may be hard to envision life without oxygen, but the first prokaryotes (the first organisms on Earth) evolved in an environment with essentially no molecular oxygen (oxygen gas, or O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Consequently, the first prokaryotes, which originated between 3.5 and 4 billion years ago, were&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;anaerobic&lt;/strong&gt;. Anaerobic is a general term that refers to any organism, environment, or cellular process that lacks or does not require oxygen, and may be poisoned by oxygen.&amp;nbsp; In contrast, &lt;strong&gt;aerobic&lt;/strong&gt; organisms require oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original anaerobic organisms thrived in an environment devoid of oxygen. Many scientists think that the early prokaryotes were chemoautotrophs, obtaining energy from inorganic chemicals, possibly using the then-abundant hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S). Evidence to support this hypothesis can be observed in some hot springs, which contain members of the Archaea. They obtain energy from the combining of ferrous sulfide (FeS) and hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3007|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cyanobacteria, originating between 2.5 and 3.4 billion years ago, were the first photosynthetic bacteria to use water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) as an electron source. They released oxygen as a waste product. These photosynthetic organisms thrived wherever there was sufficient light and a body of water. However, this created a problem on a global scale. After several hundred million years, free oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere, which marked the change from a reducing to an oxidizing atmosphere.&amp;nbsp; Evidence for this great oxygenation event can be seen in the geological record. &amp;nbsp;Initially the high levels of free oxygen were toxic to life. Organisms underwent adaptation through several mechanisms that mitigate this problem, including the use of oxygen in metabolism. Because we need oxygen for our survival, it is hard to believe that oxygen is toxic to many life forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today prokaryotes (and other life forms) exhibit various metabolic relationships with oxygen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Obligate aerobes&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;require oxygen, whereas&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;obligate anaerobes&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;have no need for oxygen and may even be poisoned by oxygen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Facultative anaerobes&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;can alternate their oxygen requirement. They can use oxygen if it is present, but they can also function in an anaerobic environment. In the upcoming tutorials on energy and cellular respiration, the role of oxygen in cellular processes and how anaerobic organisms get by without oxygen will be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Subcellular Architecture of the Eukaryotic Cell</title>
    <body>&lt;h3&gt;Introduction and Learning Objectives&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the tutorial "Life and Natural Selection", you were introduced to the complexities of defining "life".&amp;nbsp; One characteristic common to all life is cells; all living organisms are comprised of cells.&amp;nbsp; In the previous three tutorials, you learned about prokaryotic cell structure, function, and diversity.&amp;nbsp; This tutorial will focus on the subcellular architecture of eukaryotic cells, the production and transport of proteins throughout eukaryotic cells, and the evolution of eukaryotic cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic working understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;subcellular organization in eukaryotic cells&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the trafficking of proteins throughout the cell&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the role of the cytoskeleton in cell structure and function&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the Endosymbiotic Theory&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance Objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the similarities and differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain the role of the nucleus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review the organelles involved in the synthesis of macromolecules in a eukaryotic cell&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diagram the path of an exported protein from ribosome to cell membrane&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discuss the role of lysosomes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify the three components of the cytoskeleton and compare and contrast their roles in the cell&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summarize the roles of mitochondria and chloroplasts, and the evidence for their endosymbiotic origin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Organelles Involved in Protein Production</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;It used to be thought that a clear distinction between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells was the presence of membrane-bound&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;organelles&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;in eukaryotic cells (organelles are defined as specialized structures that are separated from the rest of the cell by a phospholipid bilayer).&amp;nbsp; However, we now know that some prokaryotes contain rudimentary organelles.&amp;nbsp; Despite this blurring of the lines between defining prokaryote and eukaryote, eukaryotic cells have a more complex and well-developed subcellular architecture. These membrane-bound structures play important roles in the normal functioning of eukaryotic cells and they participate in everything from constructing and exporting newly synthesized biological molecules to protecting the cell from invading pathogens. The main structures that will be examined in this tutorial can be found in this image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2392|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Nucleus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;nucleus&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is one of the most visible organelles in the cell. While it is usually only about 5 microns in diameter (approximately 1/20th the thickness of a human hair), it plays a central role in providing genetic information to the cell. The nucleus is surrounded by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2394|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nucleus also houses the nucleolus (depicted above). The&amp;nbsp;nucleolus&amp;nbsp;contains a very active group of genes that encode and transcribe ribosomal RNA (the RNA component of ribosomes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SubcellularArchitectureoftheEukaryoticCell-TheMajorRolesoftheNucleus"&gt;The Major Roles of the Nucleus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most notable function of the nucleus is to store the main genetic material within every eukaryotic cell, namely the nuclear chromosomes (additional genetic information is also found within mitochondria and chloroplasts). In addition to storage, the nucleus is also the site of all gene expression. If a new protein is to be made, a gene must first be transcribed to messenger RNA in the nucleus (you will learn more about this in the tutorial titled "From Gene to Protein: Transcription and Translation"). Once transcribed, messenger RNA exits the nucleus through&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;nuclear pores&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;in the nuclear envelope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ribosomes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3356|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ribosomes&lt;/strong&gt; are structures made of ribosomal RNA molecules and proteins and are the sites of protein synthesis in cells. Ribosomes are not enclosed in a membrane and thus are not considered organelles.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Each cell has a large number of ribosomes. &lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each ribosome has a large component and a small component that together form a single ribosome. A messenger RNA molecule travels from the nucleus to a ribosome to provide the instructions for synthesizing proteins from amino acids. &lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ribosomes are found in all cell types – both prokaryote and eukaryote.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;However, eukaryotic and prokaryotic ribosomes differ from each other enough that many of the antibiotics we use disrupt prokaryotic ribosomes but not eukaryotic ribosomes.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun:yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Thus antibiotics kill bacterial cells but do not damage our cells. &lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SubcellularArchitectureoftheEukaryoticCell-TheEndomembraneSystem"&gt;The Endomembrane System&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a functional protein is a complex process. Most proteins require a number of post-production modifications before they become functional. These modifications generally require specialized cellular structures. Protein production and modification usually takes place in a network of membrane-bound chambers called the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;endomembrane system&lt;/strong&gt;. The process begins in a network called the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;endoplasmic reticulum&lt;/strong&gt;, which literally means "network within the cytoplasm." There are two types of endoplasmic reticula in the cell: a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;smooth endoplasmic reticulum&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;rough endoplasmic reticulum&lt;/strong&gt;. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum plays a major role in synthesizing lipids and in degrading toxins. The rough endoplasmic reticulum houses ribosomes on its surface, which is where many of the proteins targeted for export outside the cell are synthesized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2396|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SubcellularArchitectureoftheEukaryoticCell-ProteinTargetingtotheRoughEndoplasmicReticulum"&gt;Protein Targeting to the Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many proteins contain signal sequences that facilitate their sorting within the cell. Newly synthesized proteins produced in the rough ER have a unique&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;signal sequence&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;that directs them to this organelle. Figure 4 illustrates the sorting process. If a translational complex (a ribosome with an associated mRNA molecule) (1) has a growing protein with this sequence at its N-terminus (the end that is synthesized first), then a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;signal recognition particle&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(SRP) binds to the growing polypeptide (2). The SRP facilitates association with the rough ER, and the translational complex docks to the rough ER at a specific receptor site located within rough ER pore complexes (3). The growing polypeptide is then inserted through the pore and translation continues; note: the polypeptide is now being inserted into the lumen of the rough ER as it is synthesized (4). Specific peptidases inside the lumen recognize the signal sequence and this short stretch is removed (5). Once translation is complete, the translational complex dissociates, leaving the newly synthesized protein inside the rough ER.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2398|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="SubcellularArchitectureoftheEukaryoticCell-TheGolgiApparatusModifiesProteins"&gt;The Golgi Apparatus Modifies Proteins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Golgi apparatus&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a component of the endomembrane system involved in processing proteins. Named for its discoverer, Camillo Golgi, the Golgi apparatus is where carbohydrates are added to proteins in a process called&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;glycosylation&lt;/strong&gt;. Proteins move from the rough endoplasmic reticulum in small membrane-bound transport vesicles to the Golgi apparatus. The side of the Golgi apparatus where proteins enter is referred to as the&amp;nbsp;cis face; it can be thought of as the receiving end of the Golgi apparatus. Transport vesicles, containing partially processed proteins, fuse with the folds of the Golgi apparatus on the cis face and bud from the trans face. Proteins move through the Golgi apparatus as they are prepared for transport to their final destinations (either within the cell or for export outside of the cell).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2400|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SubcellularArchitectureoftheEukaryoticCell-ProteinExport"&gt;Protein Export&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a protein is fully processed, glycosylated and ready for export, it next makes the trip from the endomembrane system to the cell's plasma membrane or other internal compartments (e.g., a lysosome).&amp;nbsp; The final transport vesicle that buds from the trans face of the Golgi apparatus is termed a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;secretory vesicle&lt;/strong&gt;. Secretory vesicles bind and fuse with the internal face of the plasma membrane by interacting with specific membrane proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What Holds Everything In the Cell Together?</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The inside of a cell is much more than a sack of watery cytoplasm and organelles. Within the cytoplasm is a complex scaffold of proteins that comprise the cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton is made up of three major components: microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The smallest cytoskeletal fibers are&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;microfilaments&lt;/strong&gt;, made of polymerized subunits of the globular protein&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;actin&lt;/strong&gt;, which are strung together like beads on a string. Microfilaments play a critical role in cell motility, where they facilitate cellular migration or, as in the case of muscle cells, contraction.&amp;nbsp; The movement of white blood cells illustrates the type of movement created by microfilaments.&amp;nbsp; This type of movement is called "amoeboid movement" and it is the result of the cytoplasm flowing and extending within the cell membrane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2409|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name implies,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;intermediate filaments&lt;/strong&gt; are somewhat larger than microfilaments, yet smaller than microtubules. Intermediate filaments are made of fibrous proteins wrapped around one another to form a thick, cable-like structure. Just as cables are specialized to withstand large forces, intermediate filaments play an important role in supporting cell structures and anchoring organelles in the correct position within the cell. Unlike microfilaments and microtubules, intermediate filaments are relatively static within the cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2407|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;]&lt;strong&gt;Microtubules&lt;/strong&gt; are the largest cytoskeletal element that we will discuss.&amp;nbsp; Microtubules are hollow tubes consisting of rows of paired tubulin molecules. Microtubules are important to major cellular events such as mitosis and meiosis and they also have a major structural role within the cell.&amp;nbsp; Cilia and flagella are hair-like projections on certain cells that play a role in cell motility.&amp;nbsp; The beating motion of cilia and flagella is the result of the action of microtubules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2404|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Targeting the Cytoskeleton With Drug Therapies to Treat Cancer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer cells are characterized by their rapid cell divisions. Given the importance of the cytoskeleton in cell division, it is the target of a number of cancer therapeutic drugs. For example, Taxol is a drug that is used to treat a number of cancers including breast and lung cancer.&amp;nbsp; The drug works by targeting tubulin and disrupting the mitotic spindle.&amp;nbsp; This causes mistakes in chromosome segregation and cell division and eventually kills the cell.&amp;nbsp; However, one of the major problems with targeting the cytoskeleton with drug therapies is that there are many adverse side effects associated with these drugs. This is because the cytoskeleton plays important roles throughout the cell cycle of all cells including health cells. Several drug companies are actively searching for drugs that target the cytoskeletal elements specifically involved in cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="450" src="https://voicethread.com/app/player/?threadId=2136417" width="800"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

    <title>The Organelles involved in Energy Production</title>
    <body>&lt;h3&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mitochondria
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitochondria&lt;/strong&gt; are present in the cells of most eukaryotes and they are responsible for converting the energy in food molecules into energy in the form of ATP (ATP is a high energy molecule that provides the energy for many cellular reactions). They are also quite abundant; some cells contain a single large mitochondrion, but most eukaryotic cells contain many more. Cells that require a great deal of energy (e.g., muscle cells) can house thousands of mitochondria. The basic structure of a mitochondrion is depicted in the figure below. Mitochondria are enclosed in a double membrane; a smooth outer membrane and an inner membrane that is contorted into a complex of infoldings called cristae. Cristae provide extensive surface areas for processes such as the electron transport chain, which takes place within the inner membrane. This membrane typically contains thousands of copies of electron transport chain proteins. The space within the cristae is the mitochondrial matrix.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2413|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria also possess their own genetic material in the form of circular DNA (which, as you will learn, provides an important clue as to how mitochondria arose). Mitochondria and their genetic material are maternally inherited in sexually reproducing organisms. (The sperm mitochondria rarely enter the egg during fertilization.) Therefore, mitochondria are passed to offspring in the cytoplasm of ova. Hence, your mitochondria are virtually identical to your mother's. There are many fascinating consequences associated with this phenomenon. For example, a number of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.umdf.org/site/c.dnJEKLNqFoG/b.3041929/k.BF32/Home.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;maternally inherited diseases&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;are caused by defective genes in mitochondria.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chloroplasts
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chloroplasts&lt;/strong&gt; are double membrane-bound organelles found in plants and algae that are the sites of photosynthesis. The green color of chloroplasts comes from the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like mitochondria, chloroplasts have extensive external compartmentalization that house a large number of electron transport chains that allow the organelle to efficiently convert the energy in sunlight into chemical energy for the cell’s use.&amp;nbsp; We will learn more about photosynthesis later in the course.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also similar to mitochondria, chloroplasts have their own circular DNA molecule and are thought to have an evolutionary origin that is similar to the origin of mitochondria.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3032|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3354|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SubcellularArchitectureoftheEukaryoticCell-TheEndosymbiontTheory"&gt;The Endosymbiont Theory
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2415|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is thought that mitochondria and chloroplasts evolved from prokaryotes that inhabited the cells of other larger prokaryotes. This scenario likely originated as an&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;endosymbiosis&lt;/strong&gt;, in which one organism began living within the body of another. (This type of association is very common.) In the case of mitochondria, it is thought that a relatively large prokaryote (a protoeukaryote) engulfed a smaller prokaryote (a protomitochondrion), and instead of the larger consuming the smaller, they formed an permanent relationship. This engulfment would account for the existence of the inner membrane of mitochondria (the ancestral prokaryotic membrane) and the outer membrane. The symbiosis was mutualistic because it benefited both the protoeukaryote and the protomitochondrion; the protomitochondrion was provided with a safe environment and plenty of raw materials for respiration, and the protoeukaryote was provided with a rich, free supply of fuel in the form of ATP and some safety from the oxidizing power of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; to be discussed in the next section.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chloroplasts, which are found in eukaryotic photosynthetic cells, also originated from an ancient symbiosis. In the case of chloroplasts, however, the prokaryote was photosynthetic (probably an ancient cyanobacterium; discussed later in this tutorial). In this case, the ancestors to the modern cells that possess both mitochondria and chloroplasts, at some point in the past, underwent a&amp;nbsp;serial endosymbiosis&amp;nbsp;(sequential endosymbiotic events).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SubcellularArchitectureoftheEukaryoticCell-EvidencefortheEndosymbiontTheory"&gt;Evidence for the Endosymbiont Theory
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence for the endosymbiont theory is strong. Most convincingly, mitochondria closely resemble&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;extant&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(currently existing) bacteria. Mitochondria are similar in size, and they replicate in a fashion that is very similar to binary fission. Also, the inner membrane of mitochondria bears a strong resemblance to the membranes of prokaryotes, sharing several key proteins and transport systems. Additionally, mitochondria have their own DNA (which takes the form of a circular plasmid, like that of prokaryotes) and they possess all of the cellular machinery required to transcribe and translate their genomes, thereby enabling them to produce their own proteins.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The character of mitochondrial DNA is much like that seen in modern-day prokaryotes. For example, mitochondrial DNA lack histones, which are associated with eukaryotic nuclear DNA but not with prokaryotic DNA. Additionally, mitochondrial ribosomes are more similar in behavior, structure, and nucleic acid base sequence to the ribosomes of prokaryotes than they are to eukaryotic ribosomes. For example, there is high sequence similarity between the ribosomal RNA of mitochondria and that of modern endosymbiotic bacteria.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between mitochondria and eukaryotes has grown so intimate that neither can exist without the other. Most mitochondrial genes are contained within the nucleus of their eukaryotic host cells, which makes mitochondria unable to reproduce and survive independently. Likewise, eukaryotes (e.g., humans) would be unable to manufacture enough ATP to sustain life without the help of mitochondria.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Selective Pressures Favoring Symbiosis
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime before 2.2-2.3 billion years ago,&amp;nbsp;cyanobacteria evolved the ability to use H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;to make organic molecules with the help of solar energy, in a process known as photosynthesis. The primary "waste" product from this type of photosynthesis is O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which began to accumulate in the atmosphere due to the activity of cyanobacteria. Other earlier forms of photosynthesis probably relied on H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S rather than H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and did not result in the release of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. For millions of years, cyanobacterial photosynthesis did not change the Earth's atmosphere; oxygen released by photosynthesizing mats of marine cyanobacteria combined with iron ions in the ocean, forming iron oxide that precipitated to the sea floor. When these iron ions were depleted, oxygen began to accumulate in seawater and eventually it diffused into the atmosphere.
  &lt;div class="row"&gt;
  &lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2417|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2420|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change in atmospheric composition due to cyanobacteria was enormous, even more severe than the pollution associated with industrialized civilization. Oxygen is a powerful oxidizer, and its tendency to strip electrons and attack the bonds of organic molecules can be very dangerous to living organisms. The atmospheric changes effected by cyanobacteria probably resulted in numerous extinctions, but conversely, they also led to novel adaptations (e.g., the production of antioxidants). Furthermore, some organisms also evolved the ability to detoxify oxygen by reducing it with electrons from other molecules. Electron transport chains, such as the ones that exist in modern-day mitochondria, might have evolved as mechanisms for counteracting the destructive effects of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, secondarily becoming a means of energy production over evolutionary time. The ancestors of eukaryotes might have gained an advantage in an oxygen-rich atmosphere by adopting endosymbionts to detoxify O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The additional benefit that eukaryotes enjoy today, ATP synthesis, might be a derived function.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Summary</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Eukaryotic cells are structurally more complex than prokaryotic cells, and this complexity is largely due to the appearance of discrete membrane-bound compartments in which various cellular processes are compartmentalized. In most prokaryotes, cellular processes occur within one compartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The available data indicate that two major evolutionary processes have contributed to the complexity of eukaryotic cells. First, it appears that the plasma membrane has undergone various modifications. These invaginations have resulted in complex intracellular compartments such as lysosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum, and golgi apparatuses. The majority of DNA is found within a membrane-bound nucleus. Second, the mitochondria seem to be of prokaryotic origin. There is compelling data to indicate that during the early evolution of eukaryotes, an intimate association occurred between a primitive prokaryote and a primitive eukaryote. This intracellular symbiosis became permanent over the course of time, and what exists today is a stable remnant of that ancient association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a quote by Lewis Thomas from his classic book of essays, The Lives of a Cell, which puts these facts in a provocative context:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good case can be made for our nonexistence as entities. We are not made up, as we had always supposed, of successively enriched packets of our own parts. We are shared, rented, occupied. At the interior of our cells, driving them, providing the oxidative energy that sends us out for the improvement of each shining day, are the mitochondria, and in a strict sense, they are not ours. They turn out to be little separate creatures, the colonial posterity of migrant prokaryocytes, probably primitive bacteria that swam into ancestral precursors of our eukaryotic cells and stayed there. Ever since, they have maintained themselves and their ways, replicating in their own fashion, privately, with their own DNA and RNA quite different from ours. They are as much symbionts as the rhizobial bacteria in the roots of beans. Without them, we would not move a muscle, drum a finger, think a thought....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</body>

    <title>A Real Life Example:  Protein transport and a human genetic disease</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hydrolases&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(also known as hydrolytic enzymes) are a general category of enzymes that have the ability to hydrolyze (decompose by reacting with water) various substrates. These enzymes play key roles in various types of catabolic reactions in cells and play a role in the development of various genetic diseases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gangliosides are a class of modified lipids that contain carbohydrates. Gangliosides are a prominent component of neuronal tissue, comprising about 6% of the total lipid content of the brain. Although abundant, the neuronal cells regulate the accumulation of gangliosides in two ways; first by controlling its production and second by breaking down excessive amounts using a specific hydrolase (known as hexosaminidase A). Hexosaminidase A is a lysosomal enzyme that breaks down gangliosides.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In humans, there is an alternative allele for the gene that encodes this hydrolase; homozygous recessive individuals (individuals with two copies of the disease form of the gene) are afflicted with the genetic condition Tay - Sachs disease. The disease is characterized by loss of motor skills beginning between three and six months of age with progressive evidence of neurodegeneration, including seizures, blindness, and eventual death, usually before four years of age. As a result of a founder effect (something we will study later in the course), this disease is most common in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using the terms Endoplasmic Reticulum, Golgi body, lysosome, and Signal Recognition particle, describe the predicted pathway for the production of this hydrolase in an individual who has at least one dominant allele for the protein.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would you expect homozygous recessive individuals (individuals with Tay - Sachs) to have more or less ganglioside in their neuronal tissue?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Lysosomes: the Cell&#039;s Garbage System</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Eukaryotes have a number of membrane-bound compartments that are used for a variety of purposes. One such compartment is the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;lysosome&lt;/strong&gt;. Lysosomes are involved in breaking down materials in the cell. When vesicles bud off of the plasma membrane, bringing contents from outside the cell into the cytoplasm, they first fuse with lysosomes. Special&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;hydrolytic enzymes&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(enzymes that hydrolyze/breakdown molecules) within lysosomes degrade material within the vesicles. The hydrolytic enzymes are initially synthesized in an inactive state, and only upon reaching the lysosome do they become activated. Because the active hydrolytic enzymes are compartmentalized within the lysosomes, only material within the lysosomes is degraded.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Protists I - Protists with Modified Mitochondria, Kingdoms Euglenozoa and Alveolata</title>
    <body>&lt;h3&gt;Introduction and Learning Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will introduce the protists, which include many types of eukaryotic organisms and there is great diversity in this group (such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Giardia lamblia&lt;/em&gt;, seen in this image).&amp;nbsp; The taxonomy of this group is currently under extensive revision, therefore, no two textbooks present the same taxonomic scheme. The emerging science of comparative genomics is revising the structure of the tree of life on a nearly daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2423|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course uses a tree of life that has three domains (Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya). Recall, the non-mitochondrial/chloroplast DNA in a eukaryotic cell is located within the nucleus, which is surrounded by the nuclear envelope. Eukaryotic cells also possess extensive systems of intracellular membranes that provide elaborate internal compartmentalization. Additionally, eukaryotic cells usually have organelles that are specialized for different functions. In contrast, prokaryotic DNA is concentrated in the nucleoid region, which is analogous to the eukaryotic nucleus, but is not membrane-bound (discussed in the tutorial titled "Prokaryotes I - Cellular and Genetic Organization"). Prokaryotes do not have mitochondria or chloroplasts, and they generally have internal membrane systems that are far less complex than those found in the eukaryotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial contains a number of links that have been included for your interest. The material in these Web sites need not be memorized unless the material is covered directly in the text of the tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this tutorial you should have a working knowledge of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Different groups of protists including the protists with modified mitochondria and Kingdoms Euglenozoa and Alveolata&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The role of protists in various mammalian diseases (e.g., giardiasis, trypanosomiasis, and malaria)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dinoflagellates and their ecological roles in various habitats (e.g., coral reefs and red tides)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance Objectives (for both tutorials covering the Protists):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the general characteristics of the protists&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summarize the basic classification of protists&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain why Kingdom "Protista" is no longer recognized&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify monophyletic, paraphyletic and polyphyletic groups&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For each taxonomic group of protists, identify the major characteristic(s) of that group and be able to discuss representatives that demonstrate the diversity of the group&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain different ways in which protists impact humans, either directly or indirectly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>What is a Protist?</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Many protists, but not all, are single-celled organisms. Like other eukaryotes, most have membrane-bound nuclei and organelles. Protists appear to be relatively simple organisms - only because most are unicellular. However, a closer inspection reveals that they really are surprisingly sophisticated. All of the essential metabolic functions that occur in multicellular organisms (e.g., respiration, photosynthesis, digestion, and excretion) also occur in protists. Many also have sophisticated locomotion. &lt;em&gt;Euglena&lt;/em&gt;, found in most freshwater ponds, illustrates this complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="clipboardjs-59887c95ece83"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3033|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Euglena&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;possess (within a single cell): a flagellum for locomotion; an eyespot and light detector which, when used in concert, allows them to discern the direction of the most intense light (phototaxis); chloroplasts and mitochondria; a contractile vacuole for osmoregulation; a nucleus; and an extensive endomembrane system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3009|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protists are a metabolically and ecologically diverse group. Metabolically, they range from photosynthetic autotrophic species to heterotrophic species. They occupy diverse ecological habitats ranging from marine, to freshwater, to terrestrial. They have diverse relationships with other organisms, and are found free-living or as members of various symbioses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of this diversity, protistan taxonomy is uncertain and the field is currently undergoing major changes. Some of these changes are confusing and reflect the uncertainty of how to best classify these organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some scientists still place all protists together into one kingdom, Protista. Although there are arguments for this classification scheme, in this course we will use a newer system that accommodates the great diversity of protists and recognizes many kingdoms within this group (Figure 5). Scientists working with protists generally agree that these organisms, as a group, are&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;paraphyletic&lt;/strong&gt;. While all eukaryotes arose from a single common ancestor (based on genetic sequence analyses and investigation of cellular components) and are a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;monophyletic&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;group, the group “protists” does not contain all of its descendents because the fungi, plants and animals are recognized as separate kingdoms, making the “protists” paraphyletic.&amp;nbsp; The previous classification of protists into animal-like (Protozoa), plant-like (Protophyta) and fungus-like organisms created many&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;polyphyetic&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;groups (members of the groups are descendants of different protist lineages).&amp;nbsp; Because it did not reflect the evolutionary history of the group, that classification system has been discarded but you will see&amp;nbsp; the terms "protozoa" or "protist" used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the sake of convenience we will use the term "protist," but keep in mind that this is not a taxonomic term; rather, "protist" describes a diverse group of mostly single-celled eukaryotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3013|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, you will learn about two of the five kingdoms that have been best characterized: Euglenozoa and Alveolata.&amp;nbsp; You will also learn about the protists with modified mitochondria.&amp;nbsp; In&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://wikispaces.psu.edu/display/bio/Protists+II+-+Kingdoms+Stramenopila%2C+Rhodophyta%2C+Chlorophyta%2C+and+the+Slime+Molds"&gt;t&lt;/a&gt;he next tutorial, two more kingdoms will be examined: Stramenopila and Chlorophyta. There are&amp;nbsp; protists that do not fit into these kingdoms and we will not discuss them in this course.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kingdom Euglenozoa</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2449|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;euglenozoans&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;are&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;monophyletic&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(derived from a single ancestor), they are a diverse group in terms of their feeding strategies but all members have at least one flagellum (made of tubulin) with a unique rod structure.&amp;nbsp; The unique ultrastructure of the flagella is the distinguishing characteristic of this kingdom (you do not need to know the details of these ultrastructural differences).&amp;nbsp; Kingdom&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Euglenozoa&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;includes heterotrophs, such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Trypanosoma&lt;/em&gt;, and autotrophs, such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Euglena&lt;/em&gt;. This kingdom can be divided into two groups. The first consists of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Euglena&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and its relatives, collectively called the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;euglenoids&lt;/strong&gt;. These organisms are primarily photosynthetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2451|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="clear: left;"&gt;The second group of euglenozoans is the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;kinetoplastids&lt;/strong&gt;, which includes&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Trypanosoma&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and its relatives, all of whom have one large mitochondrion and an organelle called a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;kinetoplast&lt;/strong&gt;, which stores extranuclear DNA. All kinetoplastids live in symbiosis with host organisms, and a number of them are pathogenic. For example, the disease African trypanosomiasis, or African sleeping sickness, is caused by euglenozoans from the genus&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Trypanosoma&lt;/em&gt;. African&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Trypanosoma&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;species are transmitted between mammalian hosts by the tsetse fly, a biting insect that transfers the parasite from the blood of infected individuals to the blood of uninfected hosts. The symptoms of African sleeping sickness include fatigue and confusion, which results after&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Trypanosoma&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;invades the central nervous system. This disease, although fatal if left unchecked, can be treated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2453|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]Another parasite from this same genus causes Chagas disease, or American trypanosomiasis, which is transmitted by insects known as "kissing bugs." Chagas disease, which occurs primarily in rural areas of Central and South America, affects between 8 and 11 million people and kills nearly 40,000 every year. It tends to be a chronic infection that causes acute symptoms (e.g., gastrointestinal discomfort and heart enlargement or other cardiac problems) between 10 and 20 years after infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some speculation that the debilitating fatigue and gastrointestinal distress that plagued Charles Darwin for the better part of his life after his return to England from South America was due to a chronic infection of Chagas disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Preventive measures for both African sleeping sickness and Chagas disease are largely focused on vector control, which ranges from insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) to the "sterile insect technique" - a technology used to flood a wild population of insects with sterile individuals with the goal of reducing the insect population.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kingdom Alveolata</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The kingdom&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Alveolata&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is another diverse group. It includes some of the most ecologically interesting and economically important protists, including those that build coral reefs, those that cause malaria, and some of the organisms that poison fish during harmful algal blooms. This group is monophyletic and recognizable by their&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;alveoli&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(small cavities enclosed in membranes that hug the internal cell surface). There are three distinct groups of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;alveolates&lt;/strong&gt;: dinoflagellates, apicomplexans, and ciliates.&amp;nbsp; The remainder of this tutorial will concentrate on the dinoflagellates and apicomplexans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;div class="col s12 l4"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2455|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="col s12 l4"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2458|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="col s12 l4"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2460|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ProtistsI-ProtistswithModifiedMitochondria,KingdomsEuglenozoaandAlveolata-KingdomAlveolata:Dinoflagellates"&gt;Kingdom Alveolata: Dinoflagellates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dinoflagellates&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;usually have distinct shapes due to "frames" of cellulose within their cell walls. Their cell surface has perpendicular grooves that each contain a flagellum. These paired flagella, the defining characteristic of this group, beat within their grooves and cause dinoflagellates to rotate as they move forward. The word dinoflagellate is derived from the Greek word&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;dinos&lt;/em&gt;, which means "rotation" or "whirling," and the Latin flagellum, which means "whip."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2488|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right___lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many dinoflagellates are photosynthetic and they comprise a significant proportion of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;phytoplankton&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;that floats near the surface of the ocean, making them a critical component of the aquatic food web. Phytoplankton are an essential food resource for many other organisms, ranging from heterotrophic protists to baleen whales and many other organisms in between (most of whom serve as food themselves for creatures at higher trophic levels).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="clear:both;"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2463|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all dinoflagellates are photosynthetic; many are heterotrophic. Some of these heterotrophs exploit chloroplasts from photosynthetic protists, becoming autotrophic themselves for a time. Some dinoflagellates live in symbiosis with different species, as parasites in some cases and as mutualists in others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2465|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]Some dinoflagellates, such as those in the genus&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Noctiluca&lt;/em&gt;, have the ability to&amp;nbsp;bioluminesce&amp;nbsp;(make their own light). This is accomplished with the compound luciferin, which is the same chemical that makes fireflies glow.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Noctiluca&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;floats just under the surface of the ocean, and when individuals number in the millions they can produce spectacular glowing tides. The blue in the image is the visible glow that is triggered by the tumbling dinoflagellates as the water is disrupted. If you walk along the tide line of a beach with these dinoflagellates, your footprints actually glow with each step when your foot disturbs these bioluminescent protists. How bioluminescence evolved is not completely understood. The Burglar Alarm theory posits that the bioluminescent glow attracts predators of dinoflagellate predators and this allows the glowing protist to escape predation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2467|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p left="" style="clear:"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ProtistsI-ProtistswithModifiedMitochondria,KingdomsEuglenozoaandAlveolata-DinoflagellatesandCoralReefs"&gt;Dinoflagellates and Coral Reefs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the mutualistic associations formed by dinoflagellates is their symbiotic relationship with reef-building cnidarians, animals in the same phylum as sea anemones and jellyfish. Corals engulf dinoflagellates but do not digest them; rather, these dinoflagellates, called&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;zooxanthellae&lt;/strong&gt;, live out their lives within the tissues of corals. How do you think each of the partners in this mutualistic symbiosis benefit?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2469|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2471|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coral reefs are actually composed of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;exoskeletons&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(secreted calcium carbonate shells) from countless generations of organisms, each of which anchored itself onto the remains of the previous generation, secreting more calcium carbonate and building up the reef incrementally over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some corals are capable of existing without symbiotic protists, they do not thrive and the rate of calcium carbonate deposition (reef-building) is far slower when dinoflagellates are absent. As tiny as dinoflagellates are, the energy they provide helps the corals to&amp;nbsp;build reefs that are thousands of miles long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, reefs are complex vital ecosystems that support many life forms that simply would not exist if reefs disappeared; therefore, a great many organisms are indirectly dependent on the activity of dinoflagellates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently many reefs have begun to suffer, becoming dramatically bleached in appearance as the corals lose their zooxanthellae. There have been a number of hypotheses advanced to explain this phenomenon (e.g., pollution, an increase in ultraviolet light due to the widening hole in the ozone, and global temperature changes); all of these factors can be traced back to the impact of humans on the environment. Others suggest that natural weather fluctuations or disease outbreaks may be responsible. Whatever the ultimate cause, loss of symbiotic dinoflagellates appears to be the immediate source for the bleaching.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ProtistsI-ProtistswithModifiedMitochondria,KingdomsEuglenozoaandAlveolata-DinoflagellatesandRedTide"&gt;Dinoflagellates and Red Tide&lt;/h3&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2473|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]
&lt;p&gt;Dinoflagellates are the organisms responsible for red tide events, or "harmful algal blooms" (HABs). Blooms (population explosions) of dinoflagellates are called "red tides" because dinoflagellates can reach such high densities that they actually change the color of the water in which they reside. Depending on the pigments present in these dinoflagellates, these tides will appear brown, red, orange, or yellow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; [ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2475|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;p style="clear: left;"&gt;A number of dinoflagellate species release toxins into the water, killing many aquatic animals during major algal blooms and poisoning others with sublethal doses of toxins. The primary function of these compounds is probably defensive, warding off or poisoning grazers, and perhaps preventing competing algal species from gaining a foothold in monospecific mats of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;plankton&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(minute animal and plant life in the ocean).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dinoflagellate responsible for the Florida red tide (&lt;em&gt;Karenia brevis&lt;/em&gt; ) releases neurotoxic brevetoxins into the surrounding water that are then aerosolized.&amp;nbsp; These aerosolized toxins&amp;nbsp; increase the incidence of respiratory infections among inland populations by 54%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, filter feeders, such as shellfish, are particularly vulnerable to brevetoxins because they actively ingest plankton. In turn, heterotrophs (including humans) that eat poisoned animals are often themselves unintended victims of the dinoflagellates' defensive chemicals, contracting such conditions as paralytic shellfish poisoning. The compounds involved are neurotoxins, poisons that attack the central nervous system, so they are particularly nasty, producing symptoms such as delirium and respiratory paralysis.&lt;/p&gt; [ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2477|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]
&lt;p&gt;One red tide organism,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Pfiesteria&lt;/em&gt;, is unusual in that it uses toxins specifically to kill fish, stunning them and then feeding on their tissues (or on other protists that thrive on decaying fish).&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Pfiesteria&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;also produce some of the most ecologically severe red tides, sometimes killing enormous numbers of fish. It is not clear how&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Pfiesteria&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;affect humans, but there does seem to be considerable evidence that people exposed to its toxin by physical contact with affected fish or water containing&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Pfiesteria&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;suffer various symptoms (e.g., skin lesions and loss of cognitive function).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HABs seem to be on the rise. Scientists believe that the enrichment of oceans and estuarine waters from fertilizer runoff has created an aquatic environment that favors dinoflagellate blooms. Research is underway to learn more about the causes of HABs, with the ultimate goal of designing viable control measures.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; [ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2479|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;p&gt;Can protists really be seen from space? They can if they cause red tides. NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, sponsors many programs to monitor HABs using satellite imagery. This image is from a study that is focused on the dinoflagellate&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Gymnodinium breve&lt;/em&gt;, which causes HABs in the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ProtistsI-ProtistswithModifiedMitochondria,KingdomsEuglenozoaandAlveolata-KingdomAlveolata:Apicomplexans"&gt;Kingdom Alveolata: Apicomplexans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apicomplexans&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;are parasites, specialized for living and reproducing within the tissues of animals. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;apical complex&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a cluster of microtubules and organelles located in the apex of cells that are in the infectious stage. This structure's function is to facilitate penetration of host cells. A number of apicomplexans require more than one host to complete their complicated life cycles. The infamous&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/em&gt;, which causes malaria in humans and other animals, is an apicomplexan transmitted by mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2481|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More people are killed each year by malaria than by any other transmissible disease (besides tuberculosis).&amp;nbsp; In 2015 there were 212 million cases of malaria and 429,000 deaths. Almost 90% of cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa (with the remaining 10% in Southeast Asia and South America). Malaria can strike a person multiple times per year, contributing to a major deficit in productivity, depriving families of income, and plunging many into deeper poverty.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many apicomplexan life cycles are quite complex, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is no exception.&amp;nbsp; As you can see, there are many stages in the life cycles of this parasite, and each stage infects a different host or tissue within the host. You do not need to know the details of this life cycle, but you should understand the implications of this complexity in the attempt to develop a cure for malaria.&lt;/p&gt; [ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2483|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=mediasvg]

    <title>Summary</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The protists are comprised of diverse organisms that are polyphyletic in origin. Earlier taxonomic schemes that grouped all of these organisms into a single kingdom were not very informative because they were not based on the evolutionary relationships between different protistan groups. The revised classification scheme presented here is considered superior because it does take into account these evolutionary relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you learned, not all eukaryotes have mitochondria. Keep in mind that their lifestyle (as microsymbionts) does not require these organelles because they are quite successful living in the way that they do (although, sometimes at the expense of their hosts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the kingdom Euglenozoa do have mitochondria, but are a diverse group in terms of structure. All euglenoids have a flagellum, whereas the kinetoplastids have a kinetoplast. The euglenoids are typically free-living (and can be photoautotrophic), whereas the kinetoplastids are all microsymbionts (some, like the trypanosomes, are pathogenic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of Kingdom Alveolata are even more diverse. They include the dinoflagellates that are involved in such diverse activities as coral reef building and that cause various forms of red tide. They play a major role in the ecology of ocean communities because they comprise a significant portion of the phytoplankton that&amp;nbsp;forms the basis of many aquatic food webs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apicomplexans all form parasitic symbioses, therefore, they have a major impact on other life. The causative agent of malaria is caused by&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/em&gt;. More people are killed each year by malaria than by any other transmissible disease (besides tuberculosis). Keep in mind the importance of understanding a pathogen's life cycle when public health decisions need to be made.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Protists with Modified Mitochondria</title>
    <body>&lt;p id="ProtistsI-ProtistswithModifiedMitochondria,KingdomsEuglenozoaandAlveolata-ProtistswithModifiedMitochondria"&gt;Two groups of protists - the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;diplomonads&lt;/strong&gt; and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;parabasalids&lt;/strong&gt; have modified mitochondria. The evidence suggests that each group is monophyletic but what is less clear is how closely related these two groups are to each other.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;
  &lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2437|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ProtistsI-ProtistswithModifiedMitochondria,KingdomsEuglenozoaandAlveolata-TheDiplomonads"&gt;The Diplomonads
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diplomonads have modified mitochondria (called mitosomes) that lack functional electron transport chains and thus are unable to perform cellular respiration so they derive their energy from pathways such as glycolysis (you will learn more about cellular respiration in a future tutorial). They always have flagella - but keep in mind that the structure of eukaryote flagella is distinct from the structure of prokaryotic flagella.&amp;nbsp;These organisms are found in anaerobic environments and are often parasites.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diplomonad&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Giardia&lt;/em&gt;, is an intestinal parasite responsible for the disease giardiasis or "beaver fever," which is generally transmitted via contaminated drinking water. Giardia attaches to the intestinal epithelium, or lining, in humans and other mammals (e.g., dogs, cats, bears, and beavers), creating severe diarrhea and intestinal cramps. Unlike bacterial infections, in which a large number of organisms must be ingested to cause illness, a few&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Giardia&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;individuals can cause a severe case of giardiasis. The parasite is endemic to many wilderness areas; infection can be prevented by treating the water either with a biofilter or with chemicals such as bleach. While it is a decidedly unpleasant disease to have, giardiasis is fairly easily treated with drugs.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ProtistsI-ProtistswithModifiedMitochondria,KingdomsEuglenozoaandAlveolata-TheParabasalids"&gt;The Parabasalids
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2447|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]The parabasalids are anaerobes that lack functional mitochondria but some species contain a structure known as a hydrogenosome that may be a degenerate mitochondrion. They also have flagella.&amp;nbsp;Perhaps the best known parabasalids are in the genus&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Trychomonas&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(for example,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;T. vaginalis&lt;/em&gt; is a sexually transmitted parasite that infects millions of people a year) and are parasites of animals. However, another important group of parabasalids are endosymbionts of insects and live in these animals’ guts. For example, members of the genus&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Trychonympha&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;are important symbionts in termite guts; the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Trychonympha&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;contain endosymbiotic bacteria that help them break down cellulose in the termite gut. This allows termites to consume wood (which can be a problem if they choose to eat your wooden house).

    <title>A Real Life Example:  Studying a parabasalid to improve our energy infrastructure</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Termites are an economically important insect species because of the damage they can do to wooden structures such as houses. Termites are able to use cellulose-containing materials (such as wood and paper) as a food source because their hindguts contain a complex community of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic symbionts. Many of these symbionts, such as the protist&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Trichonympha&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(a member of the trichomonads which lack functional mitochondria) and their bacterial symbionts, produce the enzyme cellulase which hydrolyzes cellulose to glucose; this glucose can then be fermented to ethanol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cellulose is the most abundant renewable resource on earth. As a result, there is current interest in developing efficient methods for turning cellulose into ethanol fuels. Currently, large scale commercial ethanol production utilizes corn as the starting material. However, there are some studies that have questioned the long-term sustainability of using corn for this purpose (i.e., when all costs associated with the production of ethanol from corn are totaled, and current farm subsidies are subtracted, there may be no value in this method of producing ethanol).&amp;nbsp; Nobel Laureate (and former Secretary of Energy) Steven Chu has suggested that the termite may help us improve the efficiency of ethanol production:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is where the termite guts come in. A billion years of evolution have produced a&amp;nbsp;highly efficient factory for turning cellulose into ethanol, unlike anything which humans&amp;nbsp;can yet design”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chu lab has worked on genetically engineering the organisms in the termite gut to produce abundant supplies of ethanol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What characteristic of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Trichonympha&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;allows us to classify them as parabasalids?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Predict what would happen to a termite population if &lt;em&gt;Trichonympha&lt;/em&gt; and their bacterial symbionts were to suddenly die?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the name of the process that produces ethanol from glucose?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Briefly describe the structure of cellulose.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>A Real Life Example: Malaria and Apicomplexans</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;April 25th is World Malaria Day - a day when the world recognizes efforts to control the spread of malaria. The most recent statistics for worldwide rates of malaria (from 2105) show a 21% decrease in the number of new cases of malaria and a 29% reduction in the number of deaths due to malaria.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this is good news, researchers are concerned about the spread of drug resistance among the &lt;em&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/em&gt; organsim that causes malaria. A spread of drug resistance can result in an increase in the number of cases of malaria.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Protists II - Kingdoms Stramenopila, Rhodophyta, Chlorophyta, and the Slime Molds</title>
    <body>&lt;h3&gt;Introduction and Learning Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will cover four protist kingdoms. They have members that are mostly photosynthetic; additionally, many members have a profound influence on humans. We will begin with a discussion of Kingdom Stramenopila, which includes the diatoms, water molds, and brown algae. Next we will examine Kingdom Rhodophyta (the red algae), &amp;nbsp;the Kingdom Chlorophyta (green algae), and will conclude with slime molds, members of the Kingdom Amoebozoa. By the end of this tutorial you should have a fundamental understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The life histories and classifications of Kingdoms Stramenopila (Phyla Bacillariophyta, Chrysophyta, Oomycota, and Phaeophyta), Rhodophyta &amp;nbsp;Chlorophyta, and Slime molds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The organisms that caused the "Great Potato Famine" in Ireland, and the outbreak of downy mildew that nearly destroyed the French wine industry&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The basic characteristics of algae, seaweeds, and kelps&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The relationship between plants and photosynthetic protists&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The relationship of the Amoebozoa to fungi and animals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance Objectives (for both tutorials covering the Protists):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the general characteristics of the protists&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summarize the basic classification of protists&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain why Kingdom "Protista" is no longer recognized&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify monophyletic, parpaphyletic and polyphyletic groups&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For each taxonomic group of protists, identify the major characteristic(s) of that group and be able to discuss representatives that demonstrate the diversity of the group&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain different ways in which protists impact humans, either directly or indirectly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Kingdom Rhodophyta</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Members of Kingdom Rhodophyta differ from other eukaryotic algae because they do not have flagellated cells at any point in their life cycles. DNA sequence data (and other sources) indicate that this lineage arose independently, sometime before Kingdom Stramenopila.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;rhodophytes&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;are marine algae, but a number of species live in freshwater and some even inhabit terrestrial niches. Like many of the photosynthetic eukaryotes, rhodophytes are characterized by accessory pigments in their chloroplasts, which endow them with unique colors. In the case of rhodophytes, also called red algae, pigments called&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;phycobilins&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;produce rich shades of pink, scarlet, and red that are so deep that they approach black. &amp;nbsp;These &amp;nbsp;red pigments allow rhodophytes to photosynthesize at water depths &amp;nbsp;that only high-energy blue and green light can penetrate. In fact, the color of rhodophyte species tends to be correlated with the depth where they commonly occur; deep-water species are often nearly black whereas shallow-water species can contain so few accessory pigments that they appear almost green, having few pigments to mask the green color of chlorophyll.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many red algae are large multicellular organisms, although they are not in the same size class as the largest of the brown algae. A number of these species are of economic importance; the odds are very good that you've eaten red algae or that you have relied on its derivatives. The seaweed used in sushi (nori) is a red alga.

    <title>Summary</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Protists are ecologically and economically significant organisms; they are responsible for a large portion of the Earth's fixed carbon and for a number of plant and animal diseases, some of which have caused considerable devastation to &amp;nbsp;humans and their crops. Considering their small size, their diversity is astounding. The beginnings of multicellularity in early protists paved the way for even greater structural complexity and diversity in taxa such as plants, animals, and fungi. For more information on the systematics and taxonomy of protists (and all other life forms), the web site of the University of California-Berkeley's Museum of Paleontology is an excellent resource, although their system of classification differs somewhat from the system used in this course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also introduced the slime molds. In a hike through the woods, you might encounter a brightly colored, fungus-like structure spreading over the surface of a decaying tree trunk; most likely, you are observing a slime mold. These are members of the Amoebozoa, the protist kingdom most closely related to fungi and animals.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>A Real Life Example:  Diatoms and symbioses</title>
    <body>&lt;p id="ProtistsII-KingdomsStramenopila,Rhodophyta,Chlorophyta,andtheSlimeMolds-ARealLifeExample:Diatomsandsymbioses"&gt;Viruses are small protein-enclosed particles that contain their own genetic material (either DNA or RNA) but can’t reproduce outside of a host cell. They are obligate parasites that need to infect host cells to replicate and they infect a narrow range of hosts. For example, the viruses that cause most common colds in humans (rhinoviruses) are only able to infect cells in the upper respiratory tract of humans. After infection, the host cells die when new viruses burst from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, biologists have come to realize that viruses play important roles in regulating and modifying most aspects of important biological processes. For example, we now know that viruses are incredibly abundant in the oceans. Measurements suggest that a milliliter of sea water contains ~10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;viruses and these viruses infect every type of organism in the sea from bacteria to whales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, a virus has been discovered (&lt;em&gt;Chaetoceros salsugineum&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;nuclear inclusion virus (CsNIV)) that infects&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Chaetoceros salsugineum&lt;/em&gt;, a species of diatom. Diatoms of the genus&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Chaetoceros&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;are abundant components of marine plankton communities. They are known to contribute to global atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide levels and are a major source of nutrition for organisms higher on the food chain. Several species of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Chaetoceros&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;are known to parasitize fish by clogging their gills.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kingdom Stramenopila</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stramenopiles&lt;/strong&gt; are a diverse, monophyletic group.&amp;nbsp; The group includes: planktonic diatoms, small single-celled or colonial freshwater protists (golden algae), large multicellular marine seaweeds (brown algae), and water molds.&amp;nbsp; The water molds include the organism responsible for the potato blight that caused a famine in Ireland where a million people died and a million people emigrated to other countries in the nineteenth century. Although this group is diverse, they all share a common characteristic, the presence of hair-like projections on their flagella.&amp;nbsp; This group is named for these projections; "stramen" means flagellum in Latin, and "pilos" means hair; hence, stramenopilans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2491|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2519|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ProtistsII-KingdomsStramenopila,Rhodophyta,Chlorophyta,andtheSlimeMolds-KingdomStramenopila:PhylumBacillariophyta(Diatoms)"&gt;Kingdom Stramenopila: Phylum Bacillariophyta (Diatoms)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p clear=""&gt;Diatoms are an important component of the global carbon cycle. Marine and freshwater plankton are full of photosynthetic diatoms. Some estimates suggest that they may be responsible for over 20% of annual global carbon fixation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Diatoms&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;are encased in a glass-like&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;silica&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;shell, lined with perforations to allow gas exchange at the cell surface. These shells, &amp;nbsp;are exceptionally beautiful structures. Each one consists of two components that fit together, like the bottom and lid of a pillbox. After the death of individual diatoms, their microscopic shells sink and gradually form thick layers of sediment (diatomaceous earth). Living diatoms avoid sinking by regulating their cellular ion concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2504|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]
&lt;p&gt;Diatomaceous earth, which essentially consists of microscopic fragments of glass from these silica shells, has numerous applications. For example, it is commonly used as a pesticide; the sharp edges of diatom shells scrape arthropod exoskeletons and gut linings, causing water loss and eventually death by desiccation. It also damages the tissues of worms and other small creatures, and often is incorporated into animal feed to reduce the occurrence of intestinal parasites. It has myriad other uses (e.g., giving scouring power to cleaning products, and allowing ultrafine filtration for scientific applications and water-purification systems).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2503|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silica shells are fairly inert, and diatomaceous earth tends to stay where it settles. Therefore, scientists can look at the assemblages of diatom species in soil cores, where the deepest layers of the sample are the oldest and represent the most distant past. They can date the samples and examine changes in the number of warm-climate diatom species and cool-climate species over time, gaining clues about ancient climatic patterns. Actually, it is not quite this simple. Other factors, besides temperature, can influence the diatom species found, and sometimes scientists do not know the temperature preferences of extinct diatom species discovered in samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diatoms are mostly photosynthetic, but there are also heterotrophic species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ProtistsII-KingdomsStramenopila,Rhodophyta,Chlorophyta,andtheSlimeMolds-KingdomStramenopila:PhylumChrysophyta(GoldenAlgae)"&gt;Kingdom Stramenopila: Phylum Chrysophyta (Golden Algae)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2502|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2506|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chrysophytes&lt;/strong&gt; are planktonic, mainly freshwater organisms that are golden in color due to specific pigments. These different pigments allow them to expand the range of light wavelengths they can use during photosynthesis. Many golden algae are predators (as well as being photoautotrophic), using&amp;nbsp;pseudopodia&amp;nbsp;(cytoplasmic "feet") to prey on smaller organisms, including diatoms and bacteria. Some possess silica scales, similar in composition to the shells of diatoms; silica also coats the quiescent cysts that form under unfavorable conditions, allowing chrysophytes to remain dormant for decades. Most chrysophytes are unicellular, but some species are colonial and elaborate in structure (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Synura&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;sp. Colony) .&amp;nbsp; Chrysophytes can have population explosions, similar to those in dinoflagellates (HABs).&amp;nbsp; These “golden tides” have result in large fish kills in some freshwater environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2508|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ProtistsII-KingdomsStramenopila,Rhodophyta,Chlorophyta,andtheSlimeMolds-ARealLifeExample:Diatomsandsymbioses"&gt;Kingdom Stramenopila: Phylum Oomycota&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oomycetes&lt;/strong&gt; include the water molds and downy mildews. Some are unicellular, while others are colonial. Most are heterotrophic decomposers that feed on dead and decaying organic matter in aquatic and terrestrial environments, but some attack living plants and animals. The name "oomycete" means "egg fungi," which is a reference to the reproductive structures of sexually reproducing oomycetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2516|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although oomycetes are not closely related to fungi, the two groups have some similarities. In particular, both groups are heterotrophs that break down food externally and then absorb nutrients from their surroundings. Additionally, many of the multicellular oomycetes form&amp;nbsp;hyphae, which are very similar to fungal hyphae although the structures are not identical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2510|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are more differences than similarities. For example, the cell walls of oomycetes are composed of cellulose, not chitin (the compound found in the cell walls of fungi). Unlike true fungi, which are haploid in the feeding stage (and the majority of their life cycle), the hyphae of oomycetes are composed of diploid cells.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resemblance between fungi and oomycetes is an example of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;convergent evolution&lt;/strong&gt;, the process by which unrelated organisms that occupy similar environments evolve similar functional traits. For example, oomycetes and fungi are decomposers and therefore stand to gain an advantage from maximizing their surface area for the absorption of food; thus, the filamentous growth form would have been favored by selection and therefore evolved independently in both lineages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oomycetes have been responsible for a number of catastrophic historic events, including the outbreak of downy mildew that nearly wiped out the French wine industry in the late nineteenth century.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Plasmopara&lt;/em&gt;, a native of the New World, was inadvertently brought to France from the United States in 1870 in a shipment of American grape root stock. It quickly became a devastating problem. A mixture of lime and copper sulfate, the first chemicals used to combat a plant pathogen, successfully treated grapes affected by this organism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2514|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oomycete&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Phytophthora infestans&lt;/em&gt;, or potato blight, was responsible for another cataclysmic event, the Great Potato Famine, which killed nearly one-million people in Ireland in the late 1800s, and drove one million more out of the country.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Phytophthora&lt;/em&gt; secretes enzymes that break down leaf and stem tissue which kills plants rapidly. Tubers can become infested, turning soft and black, seemingly overnight. Potato fields in Ireland became infested with&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Phytophthora&lt;/em&gt;, which thrived in the cool damp climate of Ireland and wiped out nearly the entire country's crop in one week. In nineteenth-century Ireland, potatoes were the primary food source of the poorest classes, who often grew nothing other than potatoes. The loss of this staple crop led to mass starvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;div class="col s12 l4"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2497|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ProtistsII-KingdomsStramenopila,Rhodophyta,Chlorophyta,andtheSlimeMolds-KingdomStramenopila:PhylumPhaeophyta(BrownAlgae)"&gt;Kingdom Stramenopila: Phylum Phaeophyta (Brown Algae)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phaeophytes&lt;/strong&gt;, or brown algae, include the largest of the protists, with some growing over 100 feet in length. The giant multicellular species that comprise "kelp forests" in temperate marine waters belong to this group. The edible alga "kombu," which is harvested by the Japanese, is also a phaeophyte. It is particularly rich in minerals, as are other marine algae. Like the chrysophytes, phaeophytes contain specific accessory pigments that give them their characteristic colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2500|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with the two kingdoms that we will discuss next, Rhodophyta and Chlorophyta, Phylum Phaeophyta includes a number of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;seaweeds&lt;/strong&gt;. Although it is not a taxonomic term, the word "seaweed" is a useful way of distinguishing large intertidal algae from other species (e.g., planktonic algae). Many types of seaweed, including those within the Phylum Phaeophyta, have complex structures that are reminiscent of plants. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;thallus&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;refers to the entire body of any seaweed that is plant-like in appearance. The thallus consists of three main parts: a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;stipe&lt;/strong&gt;, which is analogous to the stem of plants; a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;holdfast&lt;/strong&gt;, which secures the seaweed to a substrate; and leaf-like&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;blades&lt;/strong&gt;, which provide extensive surface area for photosynthesis, much as leaves do for plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2509|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another word used informally to describe a specific type of alga is "&lt;strong&gt;kelp&lt;/strong&gt;," which refers to giant seaweeds that grow in the deeper waters outside of the intertidal zone. All kelps, which form vast "forests" that support thriving marine ecosystems, are phaeophytes. As one can see, these organisms can reach very impressive sizes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kingdom Chlorophyta</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chlorophytes&lt;/strong&gt;, or green algae, &amp;nbsp;are more closely related to plants than are the other photosynthetic protists. The chlorophylls found in green algae (chlorophyll&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and chlorophyll&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;) are the same as those found in plants. Green algae also store fixed carbon as starch and they have cell walls composed of cellulose. Because they do not have many of the adaptations to a terrestrial environment that plants share, &amp;nbsp;most systematists continue to classify green algae &amp;nbsp;as a separate kingdom, but recognize that land plants arose from within this group.&amp;nbsp; This makes Kingdom Chlorophyta a paraphyletic group.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2501|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a tremendous amount of diversity within this kingdom. Chlorophytes occupy an array of habitats, including marine, freshwater and terrestrial environments. A number are seaweeds, most are freshwater algae, and some terrestrial chlorophytes (&lt;strong&gt;lichens&lt;/strong&gt;) live in a symbiotic association with fungi. The 7,000 species that comprise this kingdom range from unicellular to colonial to truly multicellular. Separate evolutionary events might have led to the evolution from single-celled green algae to colonial organisms (e.g., the beautiful&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Volvox&lt;/em&gt;), to multinucleate single-celled seaweeds, and to multicellular seaweeds (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Ulva&lt;/em&gt;). The photos below show the diversity of this group.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;
  &lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2492|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2493|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;
  &lt;div class="col s12 l4"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2494|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="col s12 l4"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2495|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="col s12 l4"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2496|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kingdom Chlorophyta also exhibits many forms of reproduction; most species reproduce asexually and sexually. For example,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Spirogyra&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is composed of long filaments of cells that can break apart and divide to produce new individuals. Alternatively, bridges can form between different individuals, allowing the exchange of gametes.

    <title>Kingdom Amoebozoa and the Slime Molds</title>
    <body>&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;div class="col s12 l4"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2511|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="col s12 l4"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2513|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one time, &lt;strong&gt;slime molds&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;were classified with the fungi because of their heterotrophic feeding habits and appearance.&amp;nbsp; Further study of these organisms has shown that they are members of the Kingdom&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Amoebozoa&lt;/strong&gt;, which includes the familiar protist &lt;em&gt;Amoeba&lt;/em&gt;. Kingdom Amoebozoa is characterized by the presence of pseudopodia that are used for locomotion and feeding.&amp;nbsp; The similarities between slime molds and fungi arose independently and are an example of convergent evolution, as we saw with oomycetes and fungi.&amp;nbsp;Myxomycetes, or&amp;nbsp;plasmodial slime molds, are among the most bizarre and beautiful organisms on Earth, often brilliantly colored in shades of yellow, orange, or pink. They &amp;nbsp;can be very large and have given some gardeners a scare when found growing on a damp pile of bark mulch. Despite their size, plasmodial slime molds are unicellular; they are large bags of cytoplasm. However, within each "cell" are many nuclei. The synchronous division of these nuclei has made slime molds very useful research organisms for the study of mitosis; additionally, many scientists study cytoplasmic streaming (the circular flow of cytoplasm that aids in moving materials within the cell) in myxomycetes because it is a relatively easy phenomenon to observe due to the size of these organisms.&lt;/p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2505|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;p&gt;Acrasiomycetes, or&amp;nbsp;cellular slime molds, are also unusual organisms. They spend most of their lives as amoeba-like single cells, but when resources are scarce they converge, joining with other cells to form units that have coordinated functions, as seen in multicellular organisms. Unlike plasmodial slime molds, the cells within the acrasiomycetes retain their cell membranes and their ability to live independently. Cellular slime molds have been used as a model system for scientists studying the behaviors of individual cells and coordination among groups of cells. Researchers studying these organisms have an active online community, Dictybase, providing a resource for the hundreds of scientists working on the cellular slime mold&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Dictyostelium&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mitosis</title>
    <body>&lt;h3&gt;Introduction and Learning Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All organisms - bacteria, tree frogs, fungi, people - grow and reproduce.&amp;nbsp; For growth and reproduction to occur, cells must divide.&amp;nbsp; In order for cells to give rise to new cells, all genetic information and cellular contents must be replicated. This tutorial and the next will focus on the cell division events that occur in eukaryotic cells - mitosis and meiosis. This tutorial will focus on mitosis and by the end of this tutorial you should have a basic working understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The role of mitosis in the life cycle of single-celled and multicellular organisms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The phases of the cell cycle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The major chromosomal events of each stage of mitosis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chromosome movement during the cell cycle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;define diploid versus haploid cells&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;describe the stages of the cell cycle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;summarize the role of mitosis in eukaryotes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;be able to diagram and label the stages of mitosis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;be able to explain why mitosis results in daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;explain the differences between karyokinesis and cytokinesis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</body>

    <title>The Cell Cycle</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Cell division is a precisely regulated process. Although&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;mitosis&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a process by which eukaryotic cell division occurs (remember, eukaryotic cells can also divide via meiosis - a process you will learn about in the next tutorial), many events need to take place prior to the physical separation of a mother cell into two daughter cells. Mitosis is a highly orchestrated process, with many checkpoints that insure events occur in the proper sequence. However, cells only divide at certain times and in specific situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2551|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the components of a cell must be replicated prior to cell division (only a fraction of the components are shown in this figure of an animal cell). The replication of new components is highly regulated. Only if the cell receives the proper signal (the nature of which is dependent on the particular cell and the environment in which it exists), will events be set in motion that lead to cell division. As long as the signal is present, the cells will continue to divide in a cyclical process known as the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;cell cycle&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3017|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]The cell cycle is a continuous process, but to make it easier to study it can be broken down into four phases. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;M phase&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the mitotic phase. The other three phases are collectively known as&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;interphase&lt;/strong&gt;. The three phases of interphase following mitosis are: the the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;growth phase, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;S phase&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;or synthesis phase, which is when DNA is replicated, and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;growth phase. Although the synthesis of nuclear DNA is restricted to the S phase, replication of cellular components can occur throughout the cell cycle (mostly being limited to G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, S, and G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Summary</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;All eukaryotes have linear chromosomes, and partitioning the chromosomes equally into daughter cells is a carefully orchestrated process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitosis insures that each sister chromatid goes into one daughter cell as the cell divides. During this continuous process, there are landmarks that mark the progression of mitosis. These landmarks are the so-called "stages" of mitosis (prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase). Be sure you know the major criteria that demarcate one stage from the other.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Introduction to Mitosis</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Single-celled organisms use mitosis to reproduce while multi-cellular organisms use mitosis to grow (this allows the organism to get larger while the cells remain small and thus preserve their surface area to volume ratio).&amp;nbsp; The dynamic process of mitosis takes many eukaryotic cells about 1-3 hours to complete. During this time, the cell completes a number of stages. Often the process is simplified and drawn as discrete steps, but it is important to remember that these steps represent landmarks in a continuous process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chromosomes that were replicated during the S phase are partitioned so that each new daughter cell has a complete set of chromosomes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Karyokinesis&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is defined as the separation of the chromosomes. The organelles and other cytoplasmic components that were replicated during G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, S, and G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;are partitioned in a process known as&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;cytokinesis&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine which stage of cell division is occurring during mitosis, we will focus on the behavior and movement of the chromosomes. The stages of mitosis are prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Major Events of Mitosis: Prometaphase and Metaphase</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3019|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the chromosomes condense, the nuclear envelope begins to disassemble (in most eukaryotes). Dissolution of the nuclear envelope signifies further progress in mitosis, and this landmark is used to identify a cell that has successfully begun&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;prometaphase&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition into&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;metaphase&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;represents an intricate cellular event whereby all of the chromosomes move into a line (the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;metaphase plate&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not understood how the cell "knows" when the chromosomes are precisely lined up. However, it is known that this is an important "checkpoint" and that the cell will not proceed to the next step until all of the chromosomes are properly positioned. The jostling of chromosomes can take a good deal of time. Therefore, this stage takes the longest time in most cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Major Events of Mitosis: Anaphase</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Each chromatid has a centromere; therefore, in metaphase, the back-and-forth jostling results in chromosomes that are not only lined up in a single plane, but each sister chromatid is aligned opposite one another. This arrangement is well suited for accurate partitioning of the chromatid.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the cell senses proper alignment along the metaphase plate, the replicated chromatids separate rapidly, signifying&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;anaphase&lt;/strong&gt;. Two notable things happen during anaphase: first, the centromeres that hold the chromatids together dissolve, separating the chromatids from each other; and second, the newly freed chromatids (now properly called chromosomes) move rapidly toward the poles.&amp;nbsp; This image shows a cell in anaphase.&amp;nbsp; The separated chromatids (now chromosomes) are stained blue and the fibers that pull the chromosomes to each pole of the cell are stained green.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Major Events of Mitosis: Telophase and Cytokinesis</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Telophase&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The replicated chromosomes (formally called chromatids) are at opposite poles at the end of anaphase. Both halves of the cell contain equal numbers and kinds of chromosomes. At this point, the nuclear membranes of the daughter cells begin to reform around the new chromosomes located at either end of the cell. At the same time, the chromosomes begin to decondense. The decondensation of chromosomes and nuclear envelope reformation characterizes the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;telophase&lt;/strong&gt; stage of mitosis. Note that these two new nuclei contain identical genetic material. For instance, in a human cell there are 46 chromosomes: 23 of paternal origin and 23 of maternal origin. Telophase marks the last part of karyokinesis (the division of genetic material).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2561|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]At the same time that nuclear membranes are reforming during telophase, something remarkable is happening to the other cellular components. Remember, the other organelles have already replicated on their own. They are also being separated into the two ends of the cell. The cell then closes off the center of the parent cell, thereby forming two new daughter cells. As previously mentioned, the process of partitioning the parental cytoplasm (including organelles) is called cytokinesis. Remember, both cytokinesis and karyokinesis are parts of mitosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cytokinesis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cell division includes the division of chromosomes (karyokinesis), as well as the division of the cytoplasm (cytokinesis). Reformation of the nuclear envelope around the daughter cell chromosomes marks the completion of karyokinesis. However, cell division is not complete until the cytoplasm has divided during cytokinesis (which typically begins during telophase).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of karyokinesis has been conserved throughout evolution. &amp;nbsp;However, cytokinesis can be accomplished in more than one way. Cells are different and these differences put constraints on cytoplasmic partitioning. Two examples are plants and animals; this figure summarizes these differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3021|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plant cells have cell membranes and rigid cell walls, however, animal cells have only cell membranes and are much more flexible. Therefore, these two types of cells have different mechanisms for cytokinesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animal cells begin cytokinesis when the cell membrane pinches inward. This is called furrowing because a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;cleavage furrow&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;forms between the two halves of the cell. The furrow gets deeper and deeper as the cytoplasm separates more and more. This process almost looks like someone is pulling a string tighter and tighter around the cell, to the point of splitting it in two. The cell membrane finally seals off and the original parental cell becomes two separate daughter cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plant cells are not able to undergo the same process because they have a rigid, inflexible cell wall. These cells divide by forming a new piece of cell wall in their center. Vesicles deposit wall-building materials along the central area of the cell. Typically, this is the same plane where the chromosomes were lined up previously during metaphase. The new cell wall begins to form and the cell membrane is extended. The two daughter cells are eventually sealed off from one another by a new cell wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other types of cytokinesis are also known, but will not be covered here. In all cases, however, the cytokinetic process is adapted to the particular character of the cell.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Major Events of Mitosis: Prophase</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The first phase of mitosis,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;prophase&lt;/strong&gt;, is marked by the condensation of chromosomes. During interphase, DNA is replicated and the replicated chromosomes remain relatively stretched out. It is difficult to visualize individual chromosomes prior to prophase using standard microscopy. This changes once the cell progresses into G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2555|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;
  &lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2555|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]

  &lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3358|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chromosomes begin to condense at some point during G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In this complex process, each replicated elongated chromosome becomes supercoiled and, as a result, becomes considerably shorter and more tightly packed (the replicated chromosome shown in the image above). Each replicated chromosome is only a few microns long, and by the end of prophase appears as two replicated, identical&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;chromatids&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;attached at the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;centromere&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(a condensed area found on all eukaryotic chromosomes). It is important to consider the significance of chromosome condensation; a highly compacted chromosome is easier to move than a stretched-out one. Moreover, chromosomes will physically be moved around in the cell later. If the DNA were stretched out, it would be subject to physical shearing. In the condensed form, it is less prone to physical damage.

    <title>Meiosis, Heredity and Life Cycles</title>
    <body>&lt;h3&gt;Introduction and Learning Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has long been noted that offspring resemble their parents in many ways, and that traits are often passed from one generation to the next. This is evident in the physical similarities of siblings, and in offspring and their parents. Although there are definite similarities between parents and offspring (and between offspring), there is also variation. After all, children never look entirely like either of their parents because they have inherited traits from both parents. Variation between generations is an important feature of natural selection because it provides the genetic basis of differential reproductive success. This tutorial will examine how chromosomes are passed from parents to offspring, and how this process gives rise to genetic variation in offspring. By the end of this tutorial you should be familiar with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Asexual and sexual reproduction&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sexual life cycles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meiosis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The two sources of genetic variation during meiosis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discuss sexual versus asexual reproduction&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify the major features of an animal life cycle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the role of meiosis in eukaryotes, and its effect on chromosome number&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Draw the major features of meiosis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diagram the process of independent assortment and calculate the number of different chromosome combinations independent assortment can produce&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diagram crossing-over in a homologous pair of chromosomes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate how events in meiosis affect heredity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</body>

    <title>Types of Reproduction</title>

&lt;p&gt;Organisms reproduce in one of two ways: asexually or sexually. In&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;asexual reproduction&lt;/strong&gt;, organisms such as bacteria produce genetically identical offspring or&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;clones&lt;/strong&gt;. The bacterium in the image above is dividing via binary fission - a cloning process.&amp;nbsp; The two bacteria that result from this process will be genetically identical to each other (unless a mutation occurs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asexual reproduction is sometimes advantageous to organisms because it is relatively fast, requires less energy, and avoids the potential for creating a bad combination of genes. The major disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that offspring are genetically identical to the parent, and this lack of genetic variation may be detrimental if conditions change and genetic diversity becomes valuable. This situation could occur with the introduction of a new disease or predator, changing environmental conditions, or other factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;sexual reproduction&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;the genetic material from two parents combines to form offspring that are genetically distinct from their parents (and that are also distinct from other siblings produced by the same parents). Even though sexual reproduction requires more energy and time than asexual reproduction, it provides offspring with a unique genetic makeup that may provide them with a selective advantage in an unpredictable environment. The key to understanding how this genetic variation is maintained lies in examining the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many of the organisms we will discuss, the exchange (or recombination) of genetic information is obligatorily coupled to reproduction, which is why such an organism is characterized as undergoing sexual reproduction. However, the exchange (or recombination) of genetic information is not always coupled to reproduction. For example, conjugation in bacteria can be accompanied by a brief exchange of genetic material without division; so, bacteria can engage in a form of sex (i.e., exchange of genetic material) known as conjugation and also undergo asexual reproduction (binary fission). Sex and reproduction are not always linked.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meiosis and Genetic Variation</title>
    <body>&lt;h3&gt;Meiosis
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diploid organisms have two sets of chromosomes, one set inherited from the father and the second set from the mother. Thus, each diploid individual has a duplicate set of each chromosome. A pair of duplicate chromosomes is known as a homologous pair. Each generation, in the production of sperm and eggs, males and females reduce their chromosome numbers in half (to the haploid number), but must insure that each gamete has a complete set of half of the chromosomes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary function of meiosis in diploid organisms is the proper distribution of homologous chromosomes into gametes. Meiosis has three phases, (1) pairing of homologous chromosomes, (2)&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;synapsis&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;of the chromosomes together (resulting in crossing over), and (3) segregation of the chromosomes into daughter cells. As shown in the image below, a diploid cell that goes through meiosis produces 4 haploid daughter cells.&amp;nbsp; Just as in mitosis, before the cell goes through meiosis, the chromosomes must replicate themselves (resulting in&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;sister chromatids&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;nonsister chromatids&lt;/strong&gt;).&amp;nbsp; Replication is followed by two divisions called meiosis I and meiosis II. At the conclusion of meiosis, four daughter cells are formed, each with one-half the normal number of chromosomes. One consequence of meiosis is that new genetic diversity arises due to two factors: the independent assortment of homologous chromosomes to gametes, and crossing over (recombination) in prophase I of meiosis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3027|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="HeredityandLifeCycles-IndependentAssortment"&gt;Independent Assortment
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first source of genetic variation,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;independent assortment&lt;/strong&gt;, occurs in metaphase I, when the homologous chromosomes line up on the metaphase plate. Orientation of the pairs is random; therefore, which chromosome (maternal or paternal) goes to each daughter cell is random. A particular daughter cell has a 50% chance of getting either the maternal or paternal chromosome for each homologous pair. The image illustrates two pairs of homologous chromosomes and how their random alignment at the metaphase plate can lead to different combinations of chromosomes in the daughter cells that are produced. The chromosome pairs align independently of one another. Therefore, the number of different combinations of chromosomes in the daughter cells is equal to 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, where n = the haploid number of chromosomes (or the number of chromosome pairs). In this example there are two chromosomes, so there are 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 4 different chromosome combinations in the daughter cells. If we look at the whole human genetic complement (n = 23), the number of different combinations is 2&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 8,388,608. Due only to the independent assortment of chromosomes in meiosis I, over 8 million genetically distinct gametes can be produced.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To calculate the number of chromosome combination possibilities use the number of chromosome pairs, not the total number of chromosomes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3029|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Crossing Over
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second source of genetic variation during meiosis is the exchange of genetic material between the maternal and paternal chromosomes, a process called&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;crossing over&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;recombination&lt;/strong&gt;. While the homologous chromosomes are paired together in prophase I, pieces of one chromosome may be exchanged with the identical portion of the other chromosome. This means that the resulting chromosomes are not entirely maternal or paternal, but rather a mixture of both. In humans, crossing over occurs about 2-3 times per chromosome pair, between nonsister chromatids only (not between sister chromatids).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3031|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Summary</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;This video (from Thinkwell) compares and contrasts mitosis and meiosis. &amp;nbsp;Be sure you can make the same comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="315" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_IzfJSxa-uA" width="560"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sexually reproducing eukaryotes undergo a series of events that can be depicted as a life cycle. There are some differences in the details of various life cycles, but the life cycle describes how the genetic composition of the cells involved in reproduction alternates between a haploid (1n) and diploid (2n) state. At some point in the life cycle, two haploid gametes fuse resulting in a diploid (2n) organism.&amp;nbsp; Later in the life cycle, one or more cells in this 2n organism undergo meiosis, giving rise to haploid gametes that can form the next generation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All eukaryotic organisms have the majority of their DNA arranged in a set of linear chromosomes found within the nucleus. Humans have 46 chromosomes (2n). Our gametes have 23 chromosomes (1n). Each of us received half of our chromosomes from each parent. However, the combination of 23 chromosomes received from each of our parents was not the same complement that our siblings received (which explains why most siblings look similar but nonidentical).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of our 23 haploid chromosomes has a similar but nonidentical partner, a homolog. It is essential to remember that homologs are&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;identical. Therefore, humans have 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes. During meiosis, these homologs will be segregated into four progeny cells, each of which will have a haploid chromosome complement. The cellular process by which these similar, yet nonidentical, chromosomes are physically moved during meiosis results in a random distribution of the 23 chromosomes into the haploid cells. Because this process occurs randomly, we can use statistics to predict the number of possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In metaphase I of meiosis, the replicated chromosomes appear situated in a row with the homologs lined up opposite one another. Importantly, how they pair is random. For example, the paternal homolog of chromosome 1 may line up on one side, whereas the paternal homolog of chromosome 2 may line up on the other side (remember, then the maternal pair would be on opposite sides as well). The odds that the paternal member of a given homologous pair lines up on one side is equal to 50% (or 0.5 or 1:1); i.e., it goes either on one side or the other. The odds that the paternal members of two chromosomes line up on the same side is then a product of their individual probabilities; i.e., 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25 (or 1:4). What would be the odds of all 23 paternal chromosomes lining up on one side? The solution is 2&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;or 1 in 8 million. This is also the odds of any other specific combination occurring during metaphase I. In metaphase II, the segregated homologs will separate. There is only one way this will occur, so the probabilities outlined for the events at metaphase I can be extended to the entire process of meiosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's put together the events occurring during meiosis for both parents. If the combination for a specific arrangement of chromosomes in each parent is 8 million, what are the odds of a specific diploid arrangement occurring? (Fertilization is somewhat random and therefore can be described statistically.) Again, the probability is a product of their independent probabilities, which is 8 million x 8 million = 64 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;p&gt;The inheritance of traits is due to the transmission of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;genes &lt;/strong&gt;from parents to offspring, and these genes code for the physical similarities that we observe. A gene is a heritable unit that codes for the production of a protein. In cells, nuclear DNA is organized into chromosomes. Genes occupy specific positions on chromosomes. More than one form of a gene may exist, and these alternative forms of the gene (&lt;strong&gt;alleles&lt;/strong&gt;)result in the formation of slightly different proteins and enzymes that result in differences between individuals (for example, in physical appearance or physiological functioning).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By passing chromosomes from parents to offspring, genes are transmitted from one generation to the next resulting in similarities between parents and offspring. All organisms have their genetic material organized into chromosomes, although the number of chromosomes differs by species (e.g., humans have 46 chromosomes, dogs have 78, cats have 34, and mosquitoes have only 6). Regardless of the number of chromosomes, the underlying principles of inheritance are the same for all species.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2816|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In humans, any cell that is not a sperm or egg contains 46 chromosomes. These 46 chromosomes occur as 23 pairs of chromosomes, and the two chromosomes in a pair are identical in length and shape (except in males, who have one pair of nonidentical chromosomes: an X and a Y chromosome).&amp;nbsp; This image is a human&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;karyotype&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;- an image of the 46 human chromosomes arranged into pairs.&amp;nbsp; Is this karyotype from a male or a female?&amp;nbsp; The two chromosomes in the pair also have the same genes; if a gene for hair color is located at one location on one chromosome (commonly referred to as a locus; plural, loci), its&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;homologous chromosome&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;will have the hair color gene at the same location. Importantly, the homologs may or may not have the same allele for the gene. This is because one homolog comes from each parent.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;p&gt;This image illustrates the human life cycle. Adults produce&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;gametes&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(reproductive cells termed sperm and eggs) by&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;meiosis&lt;/strong&gt;, and each gamete contains only one-half the number of chromosomes found in the nonreproductive cells of the parent. The nonreproductive cells (containing 46 chromosomes) are called&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;diploid cells&lt;/strong&gt;, and are abbreviated as "2&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;." The gametes (containing 23 chromosomes) are called&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;haploid cells&lt;/strong&gt;, and are abbreviated as "&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;." When a haploid ovum and a haploid sperm unite through&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;fertilization&lt;/strong&gt;, a diploid&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;zygote&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is produced. This life cycle describes how diploid (2&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;) adults produce haploid (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;) gametes, which then unite to form a new diploid (2&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;) zygote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This alternation of meiosis and fertilization is found in the sexual life cycles of all sexually reproducing organisms, but its timing can differ considerably depending on the organism. The human life cycle typifies the most common life cycle found in animals, where the gametes are the only haploid cells. They combine to form a zygote, which divides by mitosis and grows to form a new individual.&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="450" src="https://psu.voicethread.com/app/player/?threadId=2087116" width="800"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Genetic Variation</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;As previously described, meiosis gives rise to genetic variation through the independent assortment of chromosomes and recombination (or crossing-over) between pairs of homologous chromosomes. If we also consider random fertilization, the amount of genetic variation increases greatly. Let's consider the example of a human couple having a child. Over 8 million different genetic combinations are possible in the father's sperm, and an equal number in the mother's ovum. The number of unique genetic combinations would be (8 million) x (8 million) = 64 trillion when a sperm and ovum randomly unite to form a zygote. Therefore, sexual reproduction is an effective way to create offspring with genetic variation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this important?&amp;nbsp; Populations evolve and adapt through natural selection. In order for natural selection to operate, genetic variation must be present. Genetic variation leads to heterogeneity between generations; if the environment favors one variant, then this advantageous variant will increase in frequency over generational time. If environmental conditions change, individuals migrate, or new predators or pathogens are introduced, then genetic variation may allow a new variant to do better in these new conditions. Therefore, genetic variation is "insurance" for organisms against changing conditions because it helps to insure that some of their offspring will survive if conditions change.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Real Life Example: How a lack of genetic variation can cause problems</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The bananas you buy in the grocery store are seedless and sterile – they do not reproduce sexually (plant breeders produce them through asexual propagation methods).&amp;nbsp; Some scientists are concerned that a common disease of bananas, Black Sigatoka fungus, may wipe out most bananas in the world and they would no longer be a readily available food&amp;nbsp; (in many parts of the world, bananas are a staple food crop).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why are bananas more susceptible to being wiped out than a food crop that reproduces sexually?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Specifically, what aspects of sexual reproduction produce genetic variation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Fungi I - Evolution and Diversity, the Chytridiomycota, Glomeromycota, Zygomycota and Microsporidians</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will cover the vast and variable Kingdom Fungi, and its &amp;nbsp;impact on the environment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Fungi&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(fungus, sing.), like bacteria, are most commonly decomposers, assisting in the essential task of recycling nutrients in ecosystems. The majority of all plant species depend on symbiotic fungi for enhanced water and nutrient absorption. Other species have been exploited by humans for centuries for the production of bread, beer, wine, cheese, and edible fruiting bodies (mushrooms). Antibiotic-producing fungi (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Pennicillium chysogenum&lt;/em&gt;) have changed the face of modern medicine, saving millions of lives. Conversely, other species cause economically important and often devastating diseases to plants and animals (humans included). Fungal-induced plant disease epidemics have had dramatic historical influences, resulting in starvation, war, and human migration. Fungi are also responsible for the rots that damage timber, agricultural products, and human-made structures. Some fungi produce conspicuous fruiting bodies in a variety of shapes and sizes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fungi: Basic Biology and Morphology</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Although there are now more than 100,000 described species of fungi, mycologists (scientists who study fungi) estimate that there are probably more than 1.5 million species. The kingdom is comprised of six major groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microsporidians&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chytridiomycota&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zygomycota&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Glomeromycota&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ascomycota&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Basidiomycota&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3035|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The categorization of fungi is based on molecular data from DNA sequences and life cycle features. In some cases, a complete sexual life cycle has not been observed and some mycologists use a fifth phylum (Imperfecta or Deuteromycota) as a repository for these species, but with the information now available from molecular data this category is rarely used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although originally grouped with plants, modern molecular systematists now think the lineage that gave rise to modern fungi arose before plants; the molecular data suggest that this occurred just over one billion years ago. &amp;nbsp;The amoeboid protists are the sister group to fungi and animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All fungi are heterotrophic, and many are important and prolific decomposers, recycling organic carbon trapped mostly in plant cell walls as lignin and cellulose. A major distinguishing feature of the kingdom is&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;absorptive nutrition&lt;/strong&gt;. Food sources are digested externally, then absorbed into their cells. They produce large amounts of organic acids to acidify their local environment, followed by powerful digestive enzymes to break down their food source. Fungi are almost unlimited in what they can digest. Everything from trees to human skin (e.g., athlete's foot, ringworm) are subject to fungal decay.Fungi are also distinguished by their filamentous vegetative structures,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;hyphae&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(hypha, sing.; somewhat different structurally from the hyphae of the oomycetes discussed in the Protist II tutorial), and the presence of chitin as a primary cell wall polymer. A group or mass of hyphae (&lt;strong&gt;mycelium&lt;/strong&gt;) may be visible to the naked eye as a white or gray fuzz on moldy bread or on a decaying tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2833|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extensive networks of mycelia&amp;nbsp;give fungi a tremendous amount of surface area in a small space, making them ideally adapted to their absorptive mode of nutrition. Cellular specialization is somewhat limited in the kingdom. Hyphae can be characterized as having cells divided by structures called&amp;nbsp;septa&amp;nbsp;(septate hyphae), or the absence of septa (coenocytic hyphae). How is this body structure an adaptation to absorptive feeding?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many fungal plant parasites invade host tissue with specialized structures (haustoria) that are used to absorb the cellular contents of their hosts. These fungi can either decrease the fitness of the host or cause death to the host.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Fungi: Life Cycles and Reproductive Features</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Fungi exhibit several different types of life cycles. This generalized diagram&amp;nbsp;depicts the typical sequence of events in the life cycles of fungi. Focus on the "mycelium (n)" box for a starting point for both the sexual and asexual life cycles. Note, many species can produce asexual &lt;strong&gt;spores&lt;/strong&gt; by mitosis in specialized spore-producing structures. This allows the organism to clone itself while, often times, producing very large numbers of asexual spores. The hyphae of many species are haploid during the majority of their life cycles. Many fungi spend a good portion of their life in the asexual mode. The transition to the sexual mode can be triggered by certain conditions (e.g., light, temperature, moisture, availability of a sexually compatible partner, and limited nutrient availability).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3037|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sexual stage is characterized by several features that are unique to the kingdom Fungi. Most fungal mating types are morphologically indistinguishable and so, they are not referred to as male or female (fungi also do not produce gametes, sperm or eggs). Rather, they are simply referred to as "+" or "-" to let one know they are different mating types (sexually compatible). In the case of sexual reproduction, compatible mating types fuse in a process that involves&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;plasmogamy&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(fusion of cell membranes). This fusion produces a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;heterokaryon&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(a mycelium with multiple nuclei from the two mating types) or&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;dikaryon&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(a mycelium with two nuclei from the two mating types; these are found in Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes), which can divide in the growing mycelium for a prolonged period; we will use the term dikaryon in this discussion of the life cycle. The prolonged dikaryotic stage is a feature unique to fungi. It is thought that the dikaryotic state provides the organism with genetic flexibility in a competitive environment while, at the same time, conferring it with many of the same advantages as a diploid because it possesses a complementary set of chromosomes. The dikaryotic state can last for months, or even years, while the fungus continues to grow and proliferate in its environment.When environmental conditions are suitable, two haploid nuclei fuse (&lt;strong&gt;karyogamy&lt;/strong&gt;) to form a highly transient diploid state. Meiosis follows, almost immediately, in a specialized spore-producing structure, and genetically distinct haploid spores are produced.&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="450" src="https://voicethread.com/app/player/?threadId=4662030" width="800"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Chytridiomycota</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern fungal systematists have divided the fungal kingdom into six major phyla. The image below shows a simplified fungal phylogeny based on molecular data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3041|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2841|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will start with the most primitive members of the kingdom, the Chytridiomycota. Many &lt;strong&gt;chytrids&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;are aquatic, which is why they are often called "water fungi." This phylum has only recently been determined to belong to Kingdom Fungi, therefore, not all textbooks include it in this kingdom. Biologically, the approximately 1000 species are mostly &lt;strong&gt;saprobes&lt;/strong&gt; (decomposers that absorb nutrients from dead organic matter), but some species are parasites of animals, plants, or protists. They are also characterized as having absorptive nutrition and they can have septate or coenocytic mycelium, or be unicellular. Morphologically, they are important because some members possess flagellated spores. Until recently, systematists believed that the absence of flagellated cells was required for placement in the fungal kingdom. Molecular data have shown that chytrids are indeed fungi. Ultrastructural and biochemical data (e.g., chitinous cell walls) support this designation as well. The molecular data also support the theory that they are the most primitive group in the kingdom; they retain the ancestral character of having flagellated cells similar to their protistan ancestors. They are not a monophyletic group.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Summary</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;This tutorial introduced the fungi. Fungi have an important saprophytic role in the biosphere. You might not find the subject of decomposition pleasant, but without the fungi (and other decomposers) a good proportion of nutrients would remain tied up in dead organisms and never get recycled back into the biosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fungi obtain their nutrition by secreting various hydrolytic enzymes into their environment. They then absorb the resulting monomeric units. This mode of nutrition is known as absorptive nutrition and is intimately related to the role that these organisms play in degrading organic matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic aspects of fungal life cycles were also introduced. Not all fungi have a sexual mode of reproduction, but when they do, the haploid state is dominant. An important feature that fungi demonstrate is the presence of a heterokaryotic or dikaryotic state, in which multiple haploid nuclei exist in the same cell. When these nuclei fuse, the resulting diploid nucleus undergoes meiosis very soon afterward to give rise to haploid spores. Thus, the diploid state (as defined by the presence of a true diploid nucleus) is very transient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hypha is the prominent cell type in the fungal kingdom. Hyphae can exhibit tremendous growth rates via tip growth, whereby new cellular material is continuously being added to the growing tip of the extending cell. Hyphae of fungi and oomycetes are analogous structures that look the same but have different wall properties. (Fungal walls are composed of chitin, whereas the walls of oomycetes are made of cellulose.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also examined four groups of fungi, the Chytridomycota (thought to represent the most ancestral state), the microsporidians, a group of intracellular parasites, &amp;nbsp;the Zygomycota (a common bread mold), and the Glomeromycota, all of whose members are mycorhizzae in a mutualistic relationship with a land plant. Be sure you understand the life cycle of a zygomycete, and in the next tutorial you will learn how this life cycle distinguishes this phylum from others in the fungal kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Zygomycetes</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Of the roughly 900 described species in the Zygomycota, most are terrestrial and exist as saprobes in soil, on decaying plant material or on animal dung.&amp;nbsp; Many common bread molds (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Rhizopus stolonifer&lt;/em&gt;) are&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;zygomycetes&lt;/strong&gt;. Morphologically, they have coenocytic hyphae, with septa formed only in association with reproductive structures. The phylum gets it name from the production of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;zygosporangium&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2845|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image below illustrates the events in the life cycle of a zygomycete. Concentrate on the top portion of the diagram. As you have learned, two different haploid mating types are often required for sexual reproduction in the fungi. First,gametangia begin to form on hyphae of different mating types, “+” and “-“ (step 1). The gametangia then fuse (step 2) to form the heterokaryotic state (step 3). The heterokaryotic zygosporangium then develops (step 4). The zygosporangium develops a rough and thickened cell wall, which renders it resistant to harsh "over-wintering" conditions. When conditions become favorable for&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;zygospore&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;germination, the nuclei fuse (karyogamy) and a diploid is briefly formed (step 5). Meiosis immediately follows and millions of haploid zygospores are formed in the sporangium by mitosis (step 6). The zygosporangium germinates and releases the spores and the cycle begins again (step 7). The asexual stage alternates between mycelial growth and asexual spore production (as shown in bottom part of figure).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one time&amp;nbsp;the glomeromycetes were considered to be members of the Zygomycota. &amp;nbsp;However, based upon molecular data, the almost 250 species known are now recognized as a monophyletic group of fungi whose members are all mycorhizzae of plants.&amp;nbsp; They form a specific type of structure, an arbuscle (a branched shrublike organ that penetrates the root cells of vascular plants), so are called the &lt;strong&gt;arbuscular mycorrhizal&lt;/strong&gt; (AM) fungi. The arbuscle lives within the cell of the plant root, so it is termed an endophytic mycorrhizae. &amp;nbsp;A mutualistic relationship has been discovered between an AM fungus living in the thallus of &amp;nbsp;a liverwort, a member of the oldest group of land plants.&amp;nbsp; This mutualism is thought to have been very important for the colonization of land by plants and is necessary for the function of terrestrial ecosystems (over 90% of living plants have mycorhizzae).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsporidians</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The microsporidians are another recent addition to the Kingdom Fungi.&amp;nbsp; They are all intracellular parasites of animals or protists, mainly affecting invertebrates. They do not have mitochondria, but they do have mitosomes. &amp;nbsp;The presence of mitosomes, along with other fungal characteristics, distinguishes this group. &amp;nbsp;What group do you think they were previously classified in (hint: think back to the Protists)? Microsporidians have no means of locomotion, and are able to form spores that can live outside of the host cell for long periods of time.&amp;nbsp; Human microsporidiosis usually affects only people with compromised immune systems.&amp;nbsp; There is research under way to see if a mosquito-specific microsporidian could be used as a way to control malaria.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Environmental Impacts of Fungi</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Members of the kingdom Fungi produce spores. Although they are mostly nonmotile (some members of the Chytridiomycota produce flagellated spores), spores (produced by the thousands or millions) can be dispersed by water and/or wind great distances to another available substrate or host. Spores are an important taxonomic character and, as expected, come in an array of shapes and sizes. Spores can be mitotically or meiotically produced, affording the organism flexibility to reproduce and proliferate over a variety of environmental conditions where sexual recombination may not be feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2835|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fungi play many roles in the biosphere. As you have already learned, they are important decomposers as well as plant and human pathogens. They also engage in extremely important symbiotic relationships with plants and algae.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Mycorrhizae&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;are an intimate association (symbiosis) between plant roots and fungal hyphae. The vast majority are mutualistic, with the plant or tree benefiting with increased water and nutrient uptake and the fungus obtaining carbon from the roots. &amp;nbsp;All of the members of the glomeromycetes are participants in a mycorrhizal relationship with a plant.Symbioses with lichens are also common. Specific fungal species (usually Ascomycetes) grow in concert with green algae, or occasionally a cyanobacterium. The fungus gains carbon from the photosynthetic partner, and in turn it provides moisture to its photosynthetic parnter. This is a unique relationship since lichens can grow in extremely harsh climates (e.g., the arctic tundra and bare rocks) in which the algae or bacteria might not normally survive individually.&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Cordyceps&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;genus of fungi exhibits a novel method of entomopathogenesis, hijacking the nervous systems of certain insects. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another symbiotic relationship between fungi and other species are the &lt;strong&gt;lichens&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Lichens are a composite organism comprised of three partners - an ascomycete fungus, a basidiomycete fungus (both discussed in the next tutorial) as well as a photosynthetic partner – either an algae or a cyanobacterium.&amp;nbsp; For over 150 years, scientists thought that the lichens consisted of only two partners – an ascomycete and a photosynthetic partner.&amp;nbsp; It is only since 2016 that scientists have had the molecular tools necessary to discover the third basidiomycete partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lichens are considered “pioneer species” because they are usually the first organisms to colonize an area of bare rock in an environment that has been denuded by a disaster.&amp;nbsp; Over time, lichens can degrade the rocks on which they are living; the degraded rocks are turned into soil which leads the way for the movement of plants and other species into the environment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Phylum Ascomycota</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2851|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]Our discussion of fungal diversity continues with the phylum Ascomycota. With over 60,000 described species, it is the largest, most biologically and morphologically diverse group in the kingdom. It contains&amp;nbsp;some of the most destructive human and plant pathogens, including many that form various mutualistic symbioses, and varies morphologically from unicellular&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;yeasts&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;to complex cup fungi. Almost half of all members of the phylum Ascomycota form symbiotic associations with algae and basidiomycetes&amp;nbsp;to form lichens. Others, such as morels (a highly prized edible fungus), form important mychorrhizal relationships with plants, thereby providing enhanced water and nutrient uptake and, in some cases, protection from insects. In a typical forest&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;ascomycetes&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;can appear as&amp;nbsp;a conspicuous mushroom or as&amp;nbsp;disease symptoms on the surface of plant leaves. This group also contains the single-celled yeasts. These members of the Ascomycota have been exploited by humans for centuries for the production of fermented foods and beverages, such as bread and wine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Basic Morphology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2853|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]The defining morphological character of the phylum Ascomycota is the production of four to eight sexual spores in a microscopic sac-like cell called an&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;ascus&lt;/strong&gt;. Hence, they are sometimes referred to as "&lt;strong&gt;sac fungi&lt;/strong&gt;." In addition, most ascomycetes bear their asci in macroscopic fruiting bodies called ascocarps. Ascomycetes are also capable of producing enormous amounts of asexual spores called conidia, which allow them to propagate without having to undergo sexual recombination. This feature can be particularly destructive because these plant pathogenic fungi can cause devastating epidemics via repeated rounds of asexual reproduction with the dissemination of billions of conidia in a short period of time. Conidia are usually produced externally on the tips of modified hyphae in simple chains or clusters. Prior to sexual reproduction, compatible haploid mating-type hyphae (+ and -) fuse to form a dikaryotic hypha. In contrast to the basidiomycetes, ascomycetes have a more limited dikaryotic stage. The dikaryotic stage eventually gives rise to an ascocarp and sexual&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;ascospores&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the unique reproductive structure of the Ascomycota (the ascus), several species&amp;nbsp;are common model organisms. &amp;nbsp;A&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;model organism&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a non-human organism that is studied to understand particular aspects of biology. &amp;nbsp;Model organisms are usually chosen because they are readily accessible, inexpensive, reproduce quickly,&amp;nbsp;and are easy to keep alive in a laboratory. &amp;nbsp;Studying these organisms is expected to&amp;nbsp;provide insight into the workings of other organisms - particularly humans. &amp;nbsp;In the BIOL 110 lab you will be working with the ascomycete fungus &lt;em&gt;Sordaria &lt;/em&gt;to try to understand how it responds to environmental stress. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Phylum Ascomycota: Life Cycle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's turn our attention to the life cycle of the typical ascomycete. Start with step 1 in the sexual part of the life cycle, in which two compatible haploid hyphae become intertwined and form an ascogonium and an antheridium. In this case, in step 2, the ascogonium acts as a "female" and accepts nuclei from the antheridium after plasmogamy has occurred. In step 3, the resultant dikaryon is then capable of forming a cup-shaped ascocarp. In step 4, asci begin to form on the surface of the ascocarp at the tips of the dikaryotic mycelium, and in step 5, karyogamy occurs to form the highly transient diploid nucleus. In step 6, the diploid nucleus immediately undergoes meiosis, yielding four, genetically distinct, haploid nuclei. In step 7, after an additional round of mitosis, the ascus now contains eight haploid nuclei. In step 8, these eight nuclei will eventually develop into eight ascospores, which are released from the ascus on the surface of the ascocarp. In the final step in the sexual cycle (step 9), haploid mycelia arise from the aforementioned ascospores as the sexual cycle begins again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, turn your attention to the left side of the diagram. Step 10 depicts the asexual part of the life cycle. Here, a compatible haploid partner is not present and the haploid mycelium is capable of producing asexual spores (conidia) by segmentation of its hyphae. These segments will compartmentalize into conidia, and wind or water dispersal will follow.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Phylum Basidiomycota</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2857|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final&amp;nbsp;division in the kingdom Fungi that we will cover is the phylum Basidiomycota. This is the phylum that you are probably most familiar with because it contains fungi which are generally referred to as&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;gilled fungi&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;or gilled mushrooms. However, with over 25,000 classified species, it also houses diverse members such as puffballs, shelf fungi, and rusts (which are important plant pathogens).&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Basidiomycetes&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;are often called&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;club fungi&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;because the cells (&lt;strong&gt;basidia&lt;/strong&gt;) that bear the sexual spores resemble a small club. Biologically, basidiomycetes follow the same theme as the rest of the fungal kingdom; they are important decomposers, plant pathogens, and symbionts with plants (mycorrhizal). In particular, basidomycetes excel at breaking down large plant cell wall polymers (e.g., lignin found in decaying wood). Morphologically, they range in complexity from microscopic single cells to conspicuous fruiting bodies called&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;basidiocarps&lt;/strong&gt;. A mushroom that you are likely to see in a forest or at the grocery store is a basidiocarp. Produced during its sexual cycle, it can bear millions of spores on club-shaped basidia located on the surface of its gills. The production of gills underneath the cap is an adaptation that provides a large surface area for spore production. Amazingly, the surface areas on the gills of a store-bought button mushroom could cover the surface of a large trash can lid. This is an example of a highly evolved, morphological feature of gilled fungi. The gills are protected by the top of the cap and elevated by the stem of the basidiocarp for efficient wind dispersal of its&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;basidiospores&lt;/strong&gt;. Basidiomycetes have also developed unique methods for spore dispersal. Some species produce their spores on basidia in a slimy mass that emits an odor similar to rotting carrion. Flies are attracted to the smell and, in doing so, become agents of spore dispersal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Phylum Basidiomycota: Life Cycle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although some basidiomycetes produce asexual spores, asexual reproduction is far more common in the phylum Ascomycota. Therefore, we will discuss a generalized life cycle covering sexual reproduction. Turn your attention to the basidiomycete life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3045|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In steps 1 and 2, two haploid hyphae of opposite mating types fuse to produce a dikaryotic hypha. In step 3, under favorable environmental conditions (optimum temperature and moisture levels), the dikaryotic hypha is capable of producing a fruitbody; in this case, a gilled mushroom. In step 4, basidia begin to form on the surface of the gills, and in step 5, karyogamy occurs to form a diploid nucleus in each basidium. In step 6, meiosis immediately follows karyogamy and each of four genetically distinct, haploid nuclei migrates into appendages and develops into basidiospores. Basidiospores are released and wind dispersed. They germinate into haploid hyphae and the cycle begins again in step 7.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mycotoxins</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Fungi produce a variety of metabolites that impact other organisms.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Many antibiotics, such as penicillin, are fungal metabolites that are toxic to bacteria.&amp;nbsp; We have learned to use these antibacterial compounds to treat bacterial infections in humans and other animals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When these fungal metabolites are toxic to humans or other vertebrate animals, they are called &lt;strong&gt;mycotoxins&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp; While the number of mycotoxins that impacts humans is relatively small (compared to the great deal of damage done to plants and insects by fungi) those that do cause disease in humans are significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some disease-causing fungi are mostly annoying – such as the fungi that cause athlete’s foot (there are a number of different fungal species that cause this condition).&amp;nbsp; Others, such as aflatoxin, are responsible for significant human disease.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aflatoxins are metabolites produced by several species of &lt;em&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/em&gt;, particularly those that grow on grain crops.&amp;nbsp; Human exposure to aflatoxins is primarily through food – either by eating contaminated grains or consuming animals that have eaten contaminated grains.&amp;nbsp; In the US there are food safety regulations to ensure that consumers are not exposed to unsafe levels of aflatoxins.&amp;nbsp; Countries with less developed food safety systems, however, do not have these protections.&amp;nbsp; Liver cancer rates are up to 10 times higher in some developing countries than in developed countries – a situation that is linked to aflatoxin exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ochratoxins are another important disease-causing fungal metabolite (also produced by several species of &lt;em&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/em&gt;) that grow on grain crops.&amp;nbsp; Exposure to ochratoxin can result in kidney disease and may cause spontaneous abortions in pregnant women.&amp;nbsp; It has been hypothesized that high levels of ochratoxin in the environment were a selective pressure in Irish and Scottish populations that resulted in a heterozygote advantage for the allele that causes the genetic disease phenylketonuria (PKU).&amp;nbsp; This will be discussed more when we talk about genetics.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Mendel and Modern Genetics </title>
    <body>&lt;h3 id="MendelandModernGenetics-IntroductionandLearningObjectives"&gt;Introduction and Learning Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial emphasizes the work of Gregor Mendel, the father of genetics. Mendel was the first scientist to examine, in a quantitative manner, the behavior of traits between generations. By looking at the proportions of different traits in the offspring of a particular genetic cross, he was able to infer the basic tenets of modern genetics. By the conclusion of this tutorial you should have an&amp;nbsp;understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mendel and modern genetics&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The distinction between characters and traits&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meiosis and the segregation of alleles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The molecular relationship between an organisms' genotype and phenotype&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mendel's&amp;nbsp;Laws of Segregation and Independent Assortment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the experiments that Mendel did in garden peas to determine the pattern of inheritance for the characters he studied, using correct terminology&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain the phenomenon of complete dominance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create and use Punnet&amp;nbsp;Squares to make predictions about patterns of inheritance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Determine possible offspring types and phenotypic ratios resulting from a genetic cross&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summarize the relationships between meiosis and both of Mendel’s laws (Segregation and Independent Assortment)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</body>

    <title>Genetics</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2861|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]Johann Gregor Mendel&amp;nbsp;was born in 1822 and was raised on his parents small farm, in what is now the Czech Republic. After attending high school and the&amp;nbsp;Olmütz&amp;nbsp;Philosophical Institute, Mendel became a friar at an Augustinian monastery in Brno in 1843 at the age of 21. After several years of theological study, Mendel failed his teacher's examination and was sent to the University of Vienna (Austria) for two years of study from 1851-1853.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He returned to the monastery and began his studies of inheritance with pea plants (&lt;em&gt;Pisum&lt;/em&gt;) grown in the monastery's garden. He published his work in 1865; however, it went largely unnoticed until its rediscovery in 1900, sixteen years after his death. Mendel's experiments demonstrated many of the basic principles of genetics, and his studies are used to illustrate the fundamental principles of inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MendelandModernGenetics-CharactersandTraits"&gt;Characters and Traits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mendel probably chose to work with pea plants because of the many variants that exist in their&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;morphology&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(physical appearance). The color of the flowers, seeds, and pods can differ between individuals, as can the position of the flower on the stem, the length of the stem, and the shape of the seeds and pods.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Pisum&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;provided Mendel with a wide variety of characteristics with which to examine patterns of inheritance. At this point, we need to introduce the terms that Mendel referred to as a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;character&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;trait&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mendel defined a character as a heritable feature for which variants exist, and a trait as a particular variant for the character. For example, flower color is a character, whereas purple and white are traits. Other characters (and traits) that he studied included: seed color (yellow or green); seed shape (round or wrinkled); pod shape (inflated or restricted); flower position (terminal or axial); and plant height (tall or dwarf).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MendelandModernGenetics-Mendel'sTechniqueforCrossingPeas"&gt;Mendel's Technique for Crossing Peas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3048|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Pisum's&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;variety of characters and traits with which to study patterns of inheritance, Mendel also probably chose to study peas because their reproduction can be easily manipulated, which gave him strict control over the mating of different individuals. Peas will often&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;self-fertilize&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(also termed "selfing"), transferring pollen from the stamens to the carpel on the same flower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ease by which peas can be "selfed" played an important role in Mendel's studies. In some cases, Mendel wanted to cross plants with different traits. This required that he prevent selfing by removing the immature stamens before they produced pollen; he then brushed the carpel with pollen from another individual. This enabled him to control the fertilization process, and therefore the parentage of each individual. The pollinated carpel matured into a pod, and the seeds within the pod were planted to give rise to a new generation of adult plants. The mature plants (produced by the seeds) were then scored for these traits, and the process repeated again as desired. This manipulation made it possible for Mendel to keep track of the parents of each individual, and to examine how traits were transmitted through generations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MendelandModernGenetics-Mendel'sCrosses"&gt;Mendel's Crosses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3050|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mendel tracked heritable characters for three generations. In the first generation, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;P generation&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(parental generation), Mendel crossed two "&lt;strong&gt;true-breeding&lt;/strong&gt;" parents with differing traits for one or more characters. "True-breeding" means that all of the offspring &amp;nbsp;have the same trait as the parent when the offspring are produced by self-pollination. In this&amp;nbsp;image, the individual with white flowers was true-breeding because all of the offspring produced from a self-pollination had white flowers. Similarly, the individual with purple flowers only produced offspring with purple flowers when self-pollinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crossing of two true-breeding parents produced an&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;generation&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;of hybrid individuals that exhibited only the trait found in one of the two parents. The trait that was expressed in the F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;generation was termed a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;dominant trait&lt;/strong&gt;. The F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;generation hybrids were then each self-pollinated, producing an&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;generation&lt;/strong&gt;. Although not present in the F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;generation, the trait exhibited by the one parent reappeared in this generation, at approximately a 3:1 ratio of one parental trait to the other. The trait that reappeared in the F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;generation was termed a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;recessive trait&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;because it receded in the previous generation. Mendel counted large numbers (hundreds to thousands) of offspring in the F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;generation, allowing him to analyze his results mathematically; using these data he determined the mode and manner of inheritance in this species.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Ratios</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The key to understanding Mendelian genetics is to understand what ratios are and how to determine them. Let's do a few exercises to insure that you are familiar with ratios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MendelandModernGenetics-Ratioorder"&gt;Ratio order&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ratios, order means everything. In the example of Mendel's classic experiment&amp;nbsp;following the inheritance of flower color in garden peas, the F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;generation had a 3:1 ratio of individuals with purple to white flowers. The same results could be written as a 1:3 ratio of white to purple flowers. Therefore, the order of the traits listed within the ratio are important because the first number in the ratio is related to the first trait listed and the second number in the ratio corresponds to the second trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MendelandModernGenetics-Convertingcountstoratios"&gt;Converting counts to ratios&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of Mendel's actual data for individual pea plants are listed below. Note that the ratios are obtained by dividing the larger of the two counts by the smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="center"&gt;&lt;caption&gt;Data for Individual Pea Plants&lt;/caption&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flower color&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Purple = 705 individuals&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;White = 224 individuals&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;705/224 = 3.15&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Ratio of purple:white&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;flowers is 3.15:1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pod shape&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Inflated = 882 individuals&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Constricted = 299 individuals&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;882/299 = 2.95&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Ratio of inflated:constricted&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;pods is 2.95:1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3052|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An examination of the ratios listed above shows that they are all approximately a 3:1 ratio, one slightly higher and one slightly lower. The inheritance of traits is governed in some respects by probability (as you will learn in upcoming exercises), therefore, ratios are often rounded to the nearest whole number.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between ratios and fractions can be confusing. A ratio of 1:3 means that there are four "units" being considered. In other words, 1:3 does not mean 33% have one trait, while 66% have the other. Rather, 1:3 means that 25% (1 unit) have one trait and 75% (3 units) have the other. Observe the punnett square in this image&amp;nbsp;illustrating the self-pollination of an F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;pea plant for the character of flower color. We’ll learn more about punnett squares in the coming tutorials, just focus on the ratio versus the units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MendelandModernGenetics-EstimatingOffspringCountsfromRatios"&gt;Estimating Offspring Counts from Ratios&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as you can calculate ratios from counts of offspring, you can also work backwards and estimate offspring counts from ratios. Let's do an example to demonstrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cross two true-breeding parents, one with purple flowers and one with white flowers, plant the seeds produced, grow the F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;generation an allow the plants to self-pollinate, and then count the number of offspring (the F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;generation) with purple and white flowers. If you counted 1,000 offspring and there was a 3:1 ratio of purple:white flowers, how many offspring would have purple flowers? How many would have white flowers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pull out a piece of paper and pencil (and/or your calculator) to see if you can get the right answer before viewing the solution in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MendelandModernGenetics-RatioProblemSolution"&gt;Ratio Problem Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;= total number of offspring = 1,000&lt;br&gt;3:1 ratio = total of 4 "units" (3 + 1 = 4)&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;of units have purple flowers,&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;have white flowers (Recall, there was a 3:1 ratio of purple:white flowers.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 75%,&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 25%&lt;br&gt;75% purple flowers, 25% white flowers&lt;br&gt;Convert to decimal equivalent: 0.75 purple flowers, 0.25 white flowers&lt;br&gt;Numbers =&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;X 0.75 for purple,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;X 0.25 for white&lt;br&gt;purple = 1,000 X 0.75 = 750, white = 1,000 X 0.25 = 250&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimate = 750 offspring with purple flowers, 250 with white flowers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work through these slides&amp;nbsp;to reinforce the concept of a Mendelian cross: &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3364|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=h5p]</body>

    <title>Mendel and the Fundamentals of Genetics</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Mendel was not the first person to study how traits were passed between generations, however, he was the first to take a careful and quantitative look at the situation. In doing so, he made a number of inferences that continue to have a profound influence on how we think about the transmission of information between generations. He didn't know about DNA, genes, or chromosomes, but his insightful studies laid the groundwork for their discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mendel quantitatively analyzed how specific traits behaved between generations and concluded that all offspring have two factors for a given character: one was received from the father and one was received from the mother. For a given character (e.g., flower color), one trait was always expressed (i.e., purple was dominant), whereas the other trait might recede ("disappear") between generations (i.e., white was recessive). In other words, recessive traits are only expressed if the two factors are the same (in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;homozygous&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;state), whereas a dominant trait will be expressed even if only one factor is present (in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;heterozygous&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;state).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mendel proposed that the discrete units for a given character would segregate away from one another during gamete production (e.g., individuals that were heterozygous with purple flowers could produce gametes with either a white or purple factor, but not both). This is often referred to as the Law of Segregation. Mendel looked at seven different characters and found that each character behaved independent of the other. He concluded that the factors associated with different characters assorted independently (in a random fashion) from one another. This is often referred to as the Law of Independent Assortment. &amp;nbsp;You should be able to relate both the Law of Segregation and the Law of Independent Assortment to the movement of chromosomes during Meiosis I.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been about 150 years since Mendel made his observations and inferences. In the years since, geneticists have validated his basic conclusions and we now know they describe the fundamentals of genetics. While we now refer to "factors" as genes, Mendel was the first to predict their presence and behavior between generations. His basic conclusions are as correct today as they were when he first proposed them, and his work spurred the work of thousands of geneticists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MendelandModernGenetics-TheMolecularRelationshipBetweenGenotypeandPhenotype"&gt;The Molecular Relationship Between Genotype and Phenotype&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;image below illustrates the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes, with flower color used as an example. An organism's&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;genotype&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is its genetic makeup for a particular trait; that is, the alleles it has for a particular gene. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;phenotype&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the organism's appearance; that is, the trait produced by the alleles the individual has.&amp;nbsp;How does the genotype for a trait lead to the phenotype? The different alleles at a gene differ in their DNA sequences, thereby producing different enzymes when transcribed into RNA and translated into a protein. These enzymes can have different levels of activity; therefore, the organism's phenotype will differ depending on the enzymes present. The manner in which gene products interact to determine the phenotype is often&amp;nbsp;complex.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3054|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In peas, the character "seed shape" has two traits: the dominant round seed and the recessive wrinkled seed. Pea seeds contain starch, a polymer of sugar molecules. When the seed is developing, sugar in the seed is converted to starch by enzymes. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;dominant allele&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;codes for a functional enzyme that plays a role in starch biosynthesis. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;recessive allele&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;, however, has a defect in its DNA sequence and is nonfunctional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In individuals with two copies of the recessive allele (&lt;em&gt;rr&lt;/em&gt;), sugar accumulates in the developing seed because starch synthesis is incomplete. This accumulation of sugar results in the seeds taking up more water than "normal" seeds. When the seeds dry out at the end of their development,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;rr&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;seeds lose more water than&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;RR&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Rr&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;seeds, resulting in a wrinkled appearance. Heterozygous (&lt;em&gt;Rr&lt;/em&gt;) individuals have one functional copy of the starch synthesis gene and resemble the dominant homozygote because they are able to convert sugar to starch within their seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="450" src="https://voicethread.com/app/player/?threadId=2092519" width="800"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traits with simple dominant/recessive expression patterns, where one trait is completely dominant over another, such as those we have discussed so far, are called&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Mendelian traits&lt;/strong&gt;. Mendelian traits are found in humans, and include non-disease examples such as attached versus unattached earlobes, mid-digital hair, bent thumbs, and a few other traits. These traits are useful for understanding the basic principles of genetics, but as you will learn in upcoming tutorials, very few traits are actually inherited in this simple manner.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Summary</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Plant breeders have used variations in crop plants to select for improved varieties without really understanding the fundamentals of genetics. They simply crossed individuals that had the most favorable traits. The science of modern genetics is rooted in the work of Gregor Mendel, who was the first to carefully document the behavior of traits between successive generations. Mendel did not know about chromosomes or alleles, yet his observations predicted their existence. His careful analyses of monohybrid crosses allowed him to deduce that traits may skip a generation, depending on whether or not they are recessive (i.e., heterozygous recessive alleles are not expressed). In other words, he was able to infer the genetic composition (the genotype) by carefully observing the pattern of the observed character trait&amp;nbsp;(the phenotype) between successive generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now know that the reason for the particular pattern of phenotypic expression in the F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;generation is because of the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis in the F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;generation. Be sure that you understand how the segregation of chromosomes in meiosis provides a mechanism to account for the segregation frequencies observed in the F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the work of Mendel, we have learned a tremendous amount about genetics. Not only do we understand why Mendel observed the frequencies that he did in the different generations, the molecular events that relate the genotype directly to the phenotype are also understood.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Real Life Example of Mendelian Genetics</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jennifer Arnold and husband Bill Klein both have achondroplasia, a bone-growth disorder that causes dwarfism. They are stars of the reality show "The Little Couple" - Jennifer is a neonatalogist who works at the Texas Children's Hospital (she did her residency at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, where most patients older than 4 are taller than she is) and Bill is a businessman. &amp;nbsp;The show features their efforts to build a house that is customized for their size, start a new business, and have a child. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Achondroplasia is caused by an autosomal dominant allele and individuals who inherit two copies of the allele do not survive to birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is Jennifer's genotype for the gene involved in achondroplasia?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is Bill's genotype for the same gene?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jennifer and Bill hope to have a child. &amp;nbsp;What is the likelihood that they will give birth to a child with achondroplasia? &amp;nbsp;What is the likelihood that they will give birth to a child without the condition?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</body>

&lt;p&gt;A&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;monohybrid cross&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;involves the crossing of individuals and the examination of a single character (for example, flower color) in their offspring. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Punnett square&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a useful tool for predicting the genotypes and phenotypes of offspring in a genetic cross involving Mendelian traits. Learn to construct&amp;nbsp;a Punnett square by accessing the the web sites below.&amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;This is an animated Punnett square diagram of a monohybrid cross.

&lt;h2&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;Interpreting the Results of a Punnett Square
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to understanding Punnett squares is in realizing that the expected types of offspring are probabilities. The Punnett square is useful because it calculates the probability of producing each of the genotypes or phenotypes for any one offspring. Let's look at an example. A self-pollination of F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;hybrids for flower color (&lt;em&gt;Pp&lt;/em&gt;) gives a 3:1 ratio of purple:white flowers in the offspring. This means that 75% of the offspring are predicted to have purple flowers and 25% white flowers. It also means that for every offspring produced, that offspring has a 75% chance of having purple flowers and a 25% chance of having white flowers. Therefore, one would expect the number of offspring with a particular trait to be equal to the probability multiplied by&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;, the number of offspring. As you learned in the last tutorial, when working with ratios, if you are given the ratio and the total number of offspring counted you can convert the ratio to a probability and predict the number of offspring with each trait.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meiosis: The Mechanism for Segregation of Alleles</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Recall that homologous chromosomes pair during Prophase 1 of meiosis, and later, each member of the pair will be packaged into separate gametes. Therefore alleles on homologous chromosomes will segregate during Meiosis I (&lt;strong&gt;The Law of Segregation&lt;/strong&gt;), and if the genes for different characters reside on different chromosomes, they will also independently assort during Metaphase I. &amp;nbsp;(&lt;strong&gt;The Law of Independent Assortment&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the connection between genes and chromosomes started to become more clear in the years after Mendel's death, scientists noted what seemed to be a paradox in Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment and the behavior of chromosomes during gamete formation. Complex organisms must have huge numbers of genes to govern their biochemical processes, and yet, the number of chromosomes in these organisms is often small. For example, humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, whereas pea plants have 7 pairs. Therefore, each chromosome must have many genes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if there are many genes on each chromosome, how can two genes on the same chromosome &amp;nbsp;be separated from one another? The chromosome doesn't break apart during meiosis; therefore, there must be another explanation. The answer is that some genes are physically linked to one because they are located on the same chromosome, but they appear to independently assort because the chromosomes recombine (exchange genetic material) with one another. The frequency with which they do this enables scientists to "map" gene locations on chromosomes. We will examine recombination in greater detail in upcoming exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="450" src="https://voicethread.com/app/player/?threadId=2093171" width="800"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

    <title>Summary</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The phenotype of an organism arises from the complex interactions of many character traits. In a monohybrid cross, the inheritance of one character is predicted. A testcross allows the determination of the genotype of a parent with a completely dominant phenotype (homozygous dominant and heterozygotes look the same). &amp;nbsp;In a dihybrid cross two characters can segregate in several ways, with each leading to a different phenotype. How can one predict the likelihood of the different phenotypes from a dihybrid cross? This becomes relatively straightforward, providing each character trait behaves in a Mendelian fashion; that is, a simple dominant-recessive expression pattern. If the character traits are located on different chromosomes, they will segregate independently from each other. This means that the separate probabilities of each character trait can be predicted, as with a monohybrid cross. It follows then that the probabilities of these different phenotypes occurring simultaneously in the same plant will be the product of their probabilities occurring alone. &amp;nbsp;Using the Rules of Multiplication and Addition will allow you to solve genetics problems without having to use a Punnett square, which becomes cumbersome even for a dihybrid cross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, if a purple/round seeded plant that is heterozygous for both characters is crossed with itself ("selfing"), then the probability of observing round/seeded progeny will be 0.75 x 0.75 = 0.56. Be sure that you understand the logic behind this prediction and how it was calculated. Also, if there are more than two ways a given genotype can arise, then the probability is the sum of each way it can arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relatively few character traits are inherited in a simple Mendelian manner. There are a number of other basic patterns of inheritance that have been described, including incomplete dominance, codominance, multiple alleles, pleiotropy, epistasis and polygenic inheritance. These will be discussed in the next tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;p&gt;A&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;test cross&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is used to determine the genotype of an individual with a dominant trait. Because the trait is dominant, an individual &amp;nbsp;with &amp;nbsp;the trait could be homozygous or heterozygous for the trait. (This cannot always be determined by simply looking at the phenotype of the individual.) In a test cross, an individual with the dominant phenotype is crossed with a fully recessive individual. As shown in this figure, there are two possible outcomes (depending on the genotype of the parent). By examining the offspring of the cross, the unknown genotype of the dominant parent can be determined.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;Constructing a Punnett square for a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;dihybrid cross&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(a cross following the inheritance of two traits) is similar to the method used for a monohybrid cross. Determine the alleles produced by each parent, draw the Punnett square, and then combine the gametes for each cell. The following web sites should help to demonstrate the process more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A helpful equation to use in solving genetics problems is to determine the number of different gamete types an individual can produce via meiosis. &amp;nbsp;The equation is 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; = the # of different gamete types. &amp;nbsp;In this equation, n is the number of heterozygous genes the individual has. &amp;nbsp;For example, an individual of genotype AaBb can make 4 different gametes with respect to these two genes (gametes with genotype AB, Ab, aB, ab). &amp;nbsp;An individual with genotype AABb only makes two different gamete types (AB and Ab).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Using Probability</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Since the alleles (traits) &amp;nbsp;for different characters segregate &amp;nbsp;from one another, probability can be used to mathematically predict the outcomes of genetic crosses involving one or more characters. Although Punnett squares are an effective and straightforward way to examine simple genetic crosses, they are unwieldy and time consuming when the inheritance of multiple characters is examined. A more effective way to examine inheritance is to use two basic laws of probability (The Rule of Multiplication and The Rule of Addition) to determine the probabilities of different outcomes when two individuals are crossed. A little background on probability will &amp;nbsp;help your understanding. Probability scales range from 0 to 1. An event that is certain to occur has a value of 1, whereas an event that is certain not to occur has a value of 0. When you flip a coin, the probability of getting heads is&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;or 0.50, and the probability for getting tails is also&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;or 0.50. If you are rolling a single die, the probability of rolling a 1 is&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;or 0.17, as is the probability of rolling any other number on the die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the outcome of a probability event is unaffected by what has happened in previous trials, it is an independent event. When you roll a die, the chance of rolling a 1 is always&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, regardless of what you rolled previously. A lottery drawing, on the other hand, is an example of a non-independent event. If balls numbered 1 through 36 are placed in the lottery machine and mixed, the odds of getting any of the numbers is&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;36&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;on the first number drawn. However, on the second number, the odds decline to&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;35&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;because the removal of the first ball has affected the odds on the second number. For our purposes, we will be working almost entirely with independent events; however, it is important to understand the distinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PredictingPhenotypesandGenotypes-RuleofMultiplication"&gt;Rule of Multiplication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2879|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This figure&amp;nbsp;shows the role of probability when estimating offspring genotypes in Mendelian genetics. The chance of getting a particular offspring requires two independent events to occur: the segregation of alleles into ova in the female, and the segregation of alleles into sperm in the male. In this example, each of the parents is heterozygous for flower color (&lt;em&gt;Pp&lt;/em&gt;); because the two alleles in each individual segregate randomly during meiosis, the chance of getting either a&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;allele in an ova or sperm is 50%. To form an offspring with a particular genotype, the appropriate gametes must come together. The probability of this happening is determined by multiplying the probabilities of the two independent events that must occur to give the desired outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the example given, the chance of getting a homozygous dominant offspring (&lt;em&gt;PP&lt;/em&gt;) would be equal to the chance of getting a&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;allele in the ova (50%) multiplied by the chance of getting a&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;allele in the sperm (50%). Much like flipping two coins in the hope of both coming up heads, the probability of getting an offspring of this genotype would be (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) =&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The same would be true of an offspring with a&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;pp&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;genotype, as the probability of getting two&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;alleles would also be (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) =&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These examples demonstrate the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Rule of Multiplication&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows one to calculate the probability of two or more independent events occurring together in a specific combination. To determine the probability of an event occurring, determine the individual probabilities of each independent event, then multiply the individual probabilities to obtain the probability of these events occurring together. Some non-genetic examples should help to clarify this concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(a) What is the probability of getting heads three times in a row when flipping a coin?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Probability of getting heads on one flip =&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Probability of getting heads on three consecutive flips = (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) =&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;(b) What is the probability of rolling a six on two consecutive rolls of a die?* Probability of getting a six on one roll =&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Probability of getting a six on two consecutive rolls = (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)(&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) =&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;36&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PredictingPhenotypesandGenotypes-RuleofAddition"&gt;Rule of Addition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rule of Multiplication works well when there is only one way to arrive at a particular outcome, but what if the outcome can occur in different ways? For example, what is the probability of getting an offspring with the genotype&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Pp&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;in the cross shown in this figure? Notice that there are two ways to get this genotype: a&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;from the ova and a&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;from the sperm, and vice versa. To calculate this probability, use the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Rule of Addition&lt;/strong&gt;. This rule states that if an event can occur in more than one way, the probability of that event occurring is equal to the sum of the probabilities of each way the event can occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=2879|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As depicted here, the probability of getting an offspring with the genotype&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Pp&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is equal to the probability of getting&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Pp&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;from the ova,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;from the sperm) plus the probability of getting&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;pP&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;from the ova,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;from the sperm). Therefore, the probability would be&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This example demonstrates how both the Rule of Multiplication and the Rule of Addition can be used to predict the outcome of genetic crosses. To ensure that you understand the Rule of Addition, here is a non-genetic example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the probability of getting heads, at least once, in two flips of a coin? There are three possible ways to do this: heads on both flips, heads on the first flip, or heads on the second flip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(a) Use the Rule of Multiplication to calculate the probabilities of each event that satisfies the conditions of the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Probability of getting heads on first flip, heads on second flip = (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) =&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Probability of getting heads on first flip, tails on second flip = (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) =&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Probability of getting tails on first flip, heads on second flip = (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) =&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(b) Use the Rule of Addition to calculate the overall probability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Probability of getting heads, at least once, in two flips of a coin =&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;(heads on the first flip, tails second) +&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;(tails first, heads second) +&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;(heads both times)=&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>The Expression of Multiple Alleles and Pedigree Analysis </title>
    <body>&lt;h3 id="TheExpressionofMultipleAllelesandPedigreeAnalysis-IntroductionandLearningObjectives"&gt;Introduction and Learning Objectives
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mendel was able interpret the results of his genetic crosses because he took careful notes, made accurate counts, and chose traits that exhibited a clear dominant or recessive expression pattern. In fact, alleles that show simple dominant or recessive expression patterns are sometimes called "Mendelian traits".&amp;nbsp; Many alleles, however, do not behave in such a simple Mendelian manner. This tutorial will explore more complex patterns of expression as well as the application of genetic principles to the development of pedigrees. By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
  Genes with multiple alleles
  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
  The distinctions between the three types of dominance
  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
  How genes can have multiple effects
  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
  How genes can affect the expression of other genes
  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
  How some characters are controlled by more than one gene
  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
  Pedigree analysis
  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
  Cystic fibrosis
  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
  Huntington's disease
  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
  Sickle-cell disease
  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
  Phenylketonuria
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance Objectives
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
  Compare and contrast the different dominance relationships that alleles can show
  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
  Discuss the phenomenon of pleiotropy and its effect on an organism’s phenotype
 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
  Explain how epistasis affects the expression of genes
  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
  Describe polygenic inheritance
  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
  Identify the symbols used in a pedigree analysis
  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
  Identify different patterns of inheritance seen in humans using specific genes (cystic fibrosis, PKU, sickle cell anemia, and Huntington’s)

    <title>Incomplete Dominance</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3068|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mendel's experiments, offspring always looked like one of two phenotypes &amp;nbsp;due to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;complete dominance&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;of one allele over the other for characters that had two traits. This is not always the case because some genes display&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;incomplete dominance&lt;/strong&gt;. In this type of dominance relationship between two alleles, individuals who are heterozygous exhibit a phenotype intermediate between individuals who are homozygous.&amp;nbsp; For example, this figure&amp;nbsp;depicts the outcome of a cross between a snapdragon with red flowers and one with white flowers the offspring in the F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;have pink flowers. In this case neither of the alleles for flower color &amp;nbsp;is completely dominant over the other. Therefore, individuals &amp;nbsp;who are heterozygous have a phenotype unlike those with either set of homozygous alleles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Punnett square for this cross is like that for any other monohybrid cross. However, the ratio of phenotypes in the F&lt;sub&gt;2&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;generation is not 3:1 (dominant:recessive), as seen with completely dominant alleles, but rather a 1:2:1 ratio of red:pink:white flowers. Note that in this example the alleles are represented differently than in the previous examples. Since neither allele &amp;nbsp;is dominant over the other, the use of an uppercase and lowercase version of the same letter is not appropriate. In this example the character (flower color) is indicated by a letter (&lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;), and the alleles encoding the trait (white or red) are listed as uppercase subscripts (they are both uppercase because neither is dominant to the other). You may see other symbolic representations for incomplete dominance, but don't let this confuse you. The important thing to know is that some genes are expressed in an incomplete dominant manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3071|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a third type of dominance,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;codominance&lt;/strong&gt;, both alleles are expressed in the phenotype of individuals that have are heterozygous. The human MN Blood group, with alleles designated M and N is an example of codominance. This blood group is determined by the presence of a specific protein on the surface of red blood cells, such as those shown in this figure. Group M individuals have one variant (allele) of this proteins, group N have the other variant protein, and group MN individuals express both variants (alleles) of this protein. In the latter case, the heterozygote does not have an intermediate phenotype; instead, the M and N proteins are both expressed in the phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Three Types of Dominance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distinguishing between these three types of dominance is sometimes difficult.&amp;nbsp;Think of complete dominance, incomplete dominance, and codominance as a continuum of dominance relationships among alleles at a gene. At one end is complete dominance, in which the phenotype for only one of the two alleles is expressed in individuals that are heterozygous. At the other end is codominance, in which both alleles are equally expressed in individuals that are heterozygous. In between there are various levels of incomplete dominance, in which individuals that are heterozygous for the alleles display an intermediate phenotype. The key to understanding the difference between the three types is to look at the phenotype of the individuals with heterozygous alleles, then classify the relationship accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Multiple Alleles</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3073|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far we have only examined &amp;nbsp;characters with two traits that are controlled by two alleles. This is easy to visualize because diploid organisms can only &amp;nbsp;have two alleles. Within a population, however, more than two alleles can exist (although any given individual still only has two alleles).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human ABO blood group provides an example of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;multiple alleles&lt;/strong&gt;, and the structure of the cell surface antigens for the three blood type alleles is shown in this figure. There are four possible blood types for this gene: A, B, AB, and O. The letters refer to two specific carbohydrate molecules on the surface of red blood cells. Individuals can have the A carbohydrate (blood type A), the B carbohydrate (blood type B), both the A and B carbohydrates (blood type AB), or neither carbohydrate (blood type O).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that the molecules depicted above are not the same as those in the MN blood groups. In fact, MN and ABO are just two of nearly thirty different blood group systems. Collectively, over 990 alleles at approximately 39 genes control for the different surface proteins which determine the compatibility of blood type.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3075|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ABO blood groups are formed by various combinations of three different alleles; I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;(codes for carbohydrate A), I&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;(codes for carbohydrate B), and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(codes for the lack of any carbohydrate). &amp;nbsp;This figure&amp;nbsp;shows the relationship between genotype and phenotype for the ABO alleles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Punnett square can be used to predict the genotype frequencies resulting from multiple allele crosses. However, one cannot be certain of an individual's genotype if they are blood type A or B because there are two possible genotypes for each of these blood types. Therefore, many cross problems that examine blood types are similar to test crosses; that is, the parental genotype is uncertain. A few examples will aid in your understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Polygenic Inheritance</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3081|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The characters that Mendel studied are sometimes referred to as discrete characters because they can only be classified on an "either-or" basis (e.g., purple or white flowers, green or yellow seeds). Many characters cannot be classified in this manner because they vary in a population across a continuum (gradient). For example, the figure above illustrates that skin color in humans is a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;quantitative character&lt;/strong&gt;. Quantitative characters usually indicate that the character is controlled by more than one gene (&lt;strong&gt;polygenic inheritance&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This figure shows a simplification of the genetics of skin color in humans, with three genes interacting to determine the level of pigment in an individual's skin. The dominant alleles (&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;) each contribute one "unit" of pigment to the individual, and their effects are cumulative such that individuals with more of these alleles will have darker skin than those with fewer alleles. The recessive alleles (&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;) do not contribute any units of pigment. Therefore, skin color is related to the number of dominant alleles present in each individual's genotype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cross of two completely heterozygous parents produces seven phenotypes in their offspring, ranging from very light to very dark skin. The distribution of skin color in the offspring would resemble a bell-shaped curve because there would be more individuals with intermediate skin colors than either extreme. As the number of genes involved increases, the differences between the various genotypes become more subtle and the distribution fits the curve more closely. Other examples of polygenic inheritance in humans include height, hair color, and eye color. This helps to explain the &amp;nbsp;variations in these characters that we see in different individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Summary</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;This tutorial explored the more complex expression patterns of alleles. These patterns of expression do not contradict the ideas and conclusions of Mendel, but show that genes and their products can interact and/or be expressed in more complex ways. In all cases, these genes are still transmitted from generation to generation as distinct alleles on chromosomes that segregate independently during meiosis. The differences lie in how the gene product behaves within the cell, and the number of such products that contribute to a given character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some alleles can show incomplete dominance. In the snapdragon flower color we saw that three phenotypes could be traced to two alleles. In other words, two separate homozygous phenotypes resulted (as is usually seen with characters transmitted in a Mendelian manner) and a third phenotype associated with a heterozygous genotype (clearly different than the case observed with Mendelian traits, where the heterozygous phenotype is the same as the homozygous dominant genotype). How can two alleles yield three phenotypes? Consider the snapdragon. When a plant receives two alleles (a double dose) of the red allele, the flower is very red. These alleles encode for enzymes involved in the production of red pigment. The alternative alleles produce an enzyme that is nonfunctional and cannot participate in pigment synthesis. When a plant receives two copies of this nonfunctional alternative allele, pigment is not produced and the flower is white. When the plant receives one copy (a single dose) of the functional red allele, it can produce some pigment, but not as much as with two fully functional alleles, and so, the color is less red (pink).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the example above, note that the reason for the phenotypic pattern was that one allele was nonfunctional and the other functional allele resulted in a phenotype that was dependent on there being one or two copies of the functional alleles. There is another situation, however, termed codominance, in which both alleles are functional and expressed. The M and N blood groups are examples of codominance. These alleles encode for proteins that are located on the surface of red blood cells. They are similar but not identical; they differ in four amino acids. If the individual is homozygous, then the phenotype is either M or N. If heterozygous, however, then both proteins are expressed on the surface of red blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far we have considered fairly simple cases, where the number of alleles is limited to two. In fact, many genes have multiple alleles. This may seem impossible because in the diploid state there is only room for two alleles (one on the maternal chromosome and one on the paternal chromosome) of a gene. At the population level, however, many more allele forms are possible (although in any given diploid individual, only two occur at any given time). The ABO blood type is one example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, genes and their alleles may be expressed in complex ways. That is, no single trait can be attributed to a given allele. Pleiotropy describes this situation, and includes the examples of pigmentation and crossed eyes in the case of albinism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case where one gene product is used by (or dependent on) another product, epistasis can occur. This is fairly common because gene products do not function in isolation. In the example of fur color in mice, one can see that pigment synthesis and pigment deposition are two processes that must occur in order for a specific phenotype (i.e., color) to be observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also considered the case of polygenic inheritance, whereby many genes and their alleles are involved in the expression of a given phenotype. If you think about it, you will likely recognize that polygenic inheritance and epistasis are related. In fact, many traits are determined by multiple genes, which makes the analysis of expression patterns complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geneticists often study the expression of particular traits in family lineages, or pedigrees, in order to gain insight into the mode of expression for a given character trait. Not only can pedigree analyses provide insight into the mode of transmission, but importantly, they can be used to predict the genotype of particular individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tutorial examined some human genetic diseases, including cystic fibrosis, PKU, and sickle-cell disease. These diseases are found in individuals that are homozygous for the recessive allele, but as you learned, the heterozygous state has a well-documented advantage in the case of the sickle-cell disease and a probable advantage in the case of cystic fibrosis. Moreover, you learned that the phenotype can be affected by the environment; in the case of PKU, a person that is homozygous for the allele can escape the disease with a proper diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all genetic diseases that behave in a Mendelian fashion behave recessively. Huntington's disease is a degenerative disease of the nervous system. Individuals with either homozygous or heterozygous genotypes develop this disease, ensuring that the defective allele is expressed in all generations as a dominant character trait. Individuals carrying this dominant allele do not begin to show symptoms until late in life (after their child-bearing years), and so, natural selection cannot act directly to affect the frequency of this allele in the population. In other words, through their reproductive years, individuals with this detrimental allele are just as fit (likely to reproduce) as normal individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Pleiotropy</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;So far we have only considered genes that affect a single phenotypic character. &amp;nbsp;However, there are many examples showing that one gene can have multiple effects (&lt;strong&gt;pleiotropy&lt;/strong&gt;) on the phenotype. For example, people with albinism&amp;nbsp;lack pigment in their skin and hair, and also have crossed eyes at a higher frequency than pigmented individuals. This occurs because the gene that causes albinism can also cause defects in the nerve connections between the eyes and the brain. However, these two traits are not always linked, again showing the complexity of genetic interactions in determining phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In laboratory mice, the recessive "mini-muscle" (MM) allele reduces hind limb muscle mass by 50%.&amp;nbsp; Mice that are homozygous for the MM allele exhibit various pleiotropic effects, including an increase in muscle aerobic capacity, and larger hearts, livers, and spleens.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes one gene can affect the expression of another gene (&lt;strong&gt;epistasis&lt;/strong&gt;). A good example of epistasis is the genetic interactions that produce coat color in horses and other mammals. In horses, brown coat color (&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;) is dominant over tan (&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;). However, how that gene is expressed in the phenotype is dependent on a second gene that controls the deposition of pigment in hair. The dominant gene (&lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;) codes for the presence of pigment in hair, whereas the recessive gene (&lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;) codes for the absence of pigment. If a horse is homozygous recessive for the second gene (&lt;em&gt;cc&lt;/em&gt;), it will have a white coat regardless of its coat color genotype (B gene) because pigment is not deposited in the hair. &amp;nbsp;This figure&amp;nbsp;shows a Punnett square for this example. The white horses have a genotype specifying brown or tan coat color at the first gene, but are completely white because they are homozygous recessive for the gene controlling pigment deposition.At the following Web sites, find the correct answer to the multiple-choice dihybrid cross questions.

    <title>Mendelian Inheritance in Humans</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Mendelian inheritance in humans is difficult to study because humans produce relatively few offspring (as compared to many other species) and they have a generation time of about 20 years. These two factors, in addition to ethical issues, make it impossible to design breeding experiments using humans. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There are many characters in humans that show a Mendelian pattern of inheritance.&amp;nbsp; This web page, the OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man -&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.omim.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.omim.org/&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;) is a catalog of these characters. You can search for a particular character (for example, dimples) to learn more about what is known about its inheritance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TheExpressionofMultipleAllelesandPedigreeAnalysis-Pedigrees"&gt;Pedigrees
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our understanding of Mendelian inheritance in humans is based on the analysis of matings that have already occurred (the opposite of planned experiments), a family&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;pedigree&lt;/strong&gt;. Human pedigrees describe the interrelationships between parents and children, over generations, regarding a specific trait. Mendel's laws of inheritance can be used to analyze the pedigree and genotypes of the individuals in the pedigree.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TheExpressionofMultipleAllelesandPedigreeAnalysis-InheritanceofRecessiveTraits"&gt;Inheritance of Recessive Traits
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pedigree at left below&amp;nbsp;shows a pattern of inheritance that can be observed for a recessive trait. The half-filled symbols denote&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;carriers&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(heterozygotes).&amp;nbsp; Carriers are&amp;nbsp;a person or other organism that has inherited a recessive allele for a&amp;nbsp;trait but does not display that trait (or show symptoms of the disease).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Note that an individual expressing a recessive trait (homozygous recessive) may not appear every generation, but carriers are still present.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Carriers are only seen when two traits have a complete dominance relationship (one is completely dominant to the other).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;
  &lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3083|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]

  &lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3093|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pedigree above at right shows the pattern of inheritance for albinism, which typically shows a recessive mode of inheritance in humans. In this pedigree (as with most pedigree charts) heterozygotes are not marked, but you can infer their presence by the pattern of the affected individuals. Take a close look at this pedigree and locate the two cousins who marry and have children. Can you see why many societies have taboos regarding the marriage of first cousins?&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TheExpressionofMultipleAllelesandPedigreeAnalysis-PatternsofInheritanceforThreeHumanGeneticDisorders"&gt;Patterns of Inheritance for Three Human Genetic Disorders
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we will examine three diseases caused by deleterious recessive alleles:&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;cystic fibrosis&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;phenylketonuria&lt;/strong&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;sickle-cell&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;disease. Phenotypically normal parents must both be carriers (heterozygous) in order for the disease to occur in their offspring. Remember, these are recessively inherited traits; an individual must inherit one allele from each carrier parent to exhibit the phenotype. Each time two carriers conceive a child, there is a 25% chance that the child will exhibit the phenotype, a 50% chance that the child will be a carrier, and a 25% chance that the child will be a non-carrier.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TheExpressionofMultipleAllelesandPedigreeAnalysis-CysticFibrosis"&gt;Cystic Fibrosis
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common genetic diseases that affects people of Caucasian ancestry. In a room of 20-30 such persons, approximately one is a carrier. The deleterious allele that causes this disease encodes a protein that is involved in chloride ion transport. As a result, individuals with homozygous alleles for this gene have problems with salt balance in cells (particularly those cells that line the lungs and intestines). This salt imbalance causes the mucus coating of certain cells to become unusually thick, causing affected individuals to show a dangerous buildup of mucus.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cystic fibrosis is pleiotropic, and a number of symptoms can result (e.g., lung infections, sterility in males).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid lung infections, many treatments have been developed to either reduce mucus viscosity or help dislodge it from the lungs. These include various aerosolized drugs, as well as various mechanical methods. In the past, physical therapists would manually pound the patient’s chest to help dislodge sputum; now there are special vests which use air pressure to produce the same effect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this harmful allele so prevalent if it is so bad? Molecular evolutionary analyses of this allele indicate that it first appeared about 52,000 years ago (about the time when nearby eastern human populations were invading Europe to displace the Neanderthals). The prevalence of this gene in modern populations, along with its age, suggests that there probably was some selective advantage for the heterozygous state.&amp;nbsp; This phenomenon is known as "heterozygote advantage". &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Heterozygote advantage&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;describes the situation in which the heterozygote has a higher relative fitness than either the homozygote dominant or recessive genotype.&amp;nbsp; What was this advantage with regard to CF? There have been several theories but at this time, no one knows for sure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TheExpressionofMultipleAllelesandPedigreeAnalysis-Phenylketonuria"&gt;Phenylketonuria
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phenylketonuria (PKU) is not as prevalent as cystic fibrosis. About 1 in 50 persons of Caucasian ancestry carry the defective allele. (1 in 64 persons of Asian ancestry have this allele, as well as 1 in 34 persons of Irish ancestry). The disease is only observed in individuals that are homozygous for the recessive allele, and the main symptom of PKU is mental retardation. The defective allele encodes for a nonfunctional phenylalanine hydrolase enzyme that normally converts the amino acid phenylalanine to the amino acid tyrosine. Those affected with PKU accumulate high levels of phenyalanine (and/or its metabolites), therefore, they have low levels of tyrosine. The high levels of phenyalanine metabolites affect neuronal development, which leads to mental retardation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the symptoms associated with this disease can be prevented with proper nutrition. Phenylalanine is an amino acid found in many proteins; therefore, patients affected with PKU can escape the disease by strictly limiting themselves to low protein diets. Providing that PKU is detected early (most states require that all newborns be tested, which is done 24 to 72 hours after a baby is born), proper nutrition will prevent the disease. There are doctors, lawyers, and teachers who are homozygous for PKU, yet they lead normal lives (albeit with a life-long restricted diet).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PKU is a good example of not only a disease caused by a recessive allele, but also an example of a genetic condition in which the phenotype is strongly affected by the environment; with the proper diet, the phenotype is not expressed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="TheExpressionofMultipleAllelesandPedigreeAnalysis-Sickle-CellAnemia"&gt;Sickle-Cell Anemia
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sickle-cell disease is one of the most common genetic diseases that affects mainly persons of African ancestry. About 10% carry the allele for this trait. (In some areas of Africa, upwards of 40% carry the allele.) Individuals that are homozygous for the sickle cell allele have sickle-cell disease and suffer from a number of problems including anemia, pain, fever, and fatigue. The sickle-cell trait affects the hemoglobin molecule found in red blood cells, which is involved in oxygen transport. Left untreated, patients with sickle-cell disease typically die by the age of thirty.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with cystic fibrosis, the high prevalence of the allele in the population suggests that there is some benefit to carrying it in a heterozygous state. Indeed, this is the case. It is known that those individuals who are heterozygous are less susceptible to malaria than those who are homozygous for the normal hemoglobin allele.. It is not surprising then that the highest frequency of the sickle cell allele is found in areas where malaria is prevalent. This allele is one of the best examples of natural selection in humans as well as one of the best examples of heterozygote advantage.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="TheExpressionofMultipleAllelesandPedigreeAnalysis-InheritanceofDominantTraits"&gt;Inheritance of Dominant Traits
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure below shows a pedigree of brachydactyly - a dominant condition associated with shortness of fingers and toes.&amp;nbsp;The actress Megan Fox has brachydactyly of her thumbs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pedigree examples shown here best fit a dominant pattern of inheritance because:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The trait does not skip a generation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Where one parent is affected, about half of the progeny are affected..&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="TheExpressionofMultipleAllelesandPedigreeAnalysis-Huntington'sChorea"&gt;Huntington's Disease
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Huntingtons Disease&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(HD) is a hereditary disease that causes progressive damage to the nervous system. It generally develops subtly in a person's thirties or forties (though it can begin any time between childhood and old age). It is characterized by difficulties in three areas: uncontrollable movements, dementia, and psychiatric disturbances. &amp;nbsp;Unlike the previous diseases described, which were caused by recessive alleles, HD is caused by a dominant allele. Most HD sufferers have one copy of the deleterious allele and one normal allele, so each of their children has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. As you just read in the description of inheritance of dominant traits, HD does not tend to skip generations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note the late onset of this disease. This disease becomes noticeable after the normal child-bearing age. Also, consider that the life expectancy of men in America in the year 1900 was forty-six. Therefore, for much of modern human history (about 100,000-150,000 years) this disease probably was not prevalent because people died of other causes before HD symptoms appeared.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This figure shows a pedigree for woolly hair - a condition characterized by tightly coiled hair. &amp;nbsp;It is a dominant condition.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The man at the top of the pedigree has normal hair, so his genotype is ww. His wife has woolly hair, but must be heterozygous (Ww) since three of their six children have normal hair.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pedigree not only allows a geneticist to understand the past, but it helps to predict the occurrence of a trait in future generations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a woolly hair grandson marries a normal hair woman and they plan on having three children, the probability that all three children will have woolly hair is&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. Since the man is heterozygous (Ww) and the wife is homozygous (ww), each child has a&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;probability of inheriting the woolly hair allele (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;X&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;X&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;).

    <title>A Real Life Example: Puppies and Pedigrees!</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Your neighbor has a female Labrador retriever. This breed has three coat colors, black,&amp;nbsp;chocolate, and yellow. Black labs are dark as night, chocolate labs are a deep, deep&amp;nbsp;brown, and yellow labs appear light brown to white. Their nose, lips and gums can be&amp;nbsp;either brown or black. Your neighbor’s dog is yellow with a black nose. He breeds his&amp;nbsp;dog with a chocolate lab with a brown nose. A photo of the litter is below (the mother is&amp;nbsp;on the left of Figure 13 and all puppies are either black or yellow and have a black nose). Your&amp;nbsp;neighbor has read on a web site that coat color is due to an epistatic interaction between a&amp;nbsp;gene that determines chocolate or black pigment color (designated B) and a gene that is&amp;nbsp;involved in pigment deposition (designated E). Each gene has a recessive allele that does&amp;nbsp;not function. Black labs are B_/E_; chocolate labs are bb/E_; and yellow labs are __/ee. &amp;nbsp;The “E” gene does not appear to be involved in the deposition of pigment to the nose and&amp;nbsp;gums. He comes to you and wants to know the genotype of his dog and he also is a bit confused about the word epistasis because it seems to him that he can explain his litter&amp;nbsp;based on the action of just one gene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Given these facts, what is the most likely genotype of your neighbor’s dog?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does this example demonstrate epistasis?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Chromosome Behavior and Sex Chromosomes</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3094|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gregor Mendel concluded from his experiments that "hereditary units" transmitted traits from one generation to the next, but at the time of his work (1850-1860's) chromosomes had not yet been observed. Around the turn of the century, two events firmly placed Mendel's name in history. First, three botanists independently rediscovered Mendel's research after conducting studies similar to his. Second, scientists began to notice differences between the behavior of chromosomes (only recently observed) during mitosis and meiosis. For example, they saw that organisms had pairs of homologous chromosomes that separated during meiosis, and that the fusion of two gametes resulted in a zygote with the normal diploid number of chromosomes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;These facts meshed well with Mendel's Laws of Segregation and Independent Assortment, demonstrating that chromosomes contained the "hereditary units" proposed by Mendel. Mendel's work and the discovery of chromosomes and their behavior laid the groundwork for studies which revealed that genes are found in specific locations on chromosomes, and that homologous chromosomes segregate and non-homologous chromosomes independently assort during meiosis. This tutorial will more closely examine the role that chromosomes play in allele segregation. You will learn that genes (and their alleles) on different chromosomes segregate (or assort) independently. If they are on the same chromosome, however, they may or may not exhibit independent segregation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How chromosome behavior explains allele segregation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gender determination in humans and other organisms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inheritance of other sex-linked genes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Role of X-inactivation in gene expression&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>The Relationship Between Chromosome Behavior and Mendel&#039;s Laws</title>

&lt;p&gt;This figure&amp;nbsp;demonstrates the relationship between Mendel's work and the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis. It shows how a dihybrid individual has two different alleles for each gene: here seed color (Y gene) and shape (R gene); the locations of the genes are indicated by lines on the chromosomes. Each gene is located at the same position on each member of the homologous pair. The random assortment of the homologous pairs in meiosis I results in different combinations of alleles for seed color and shape in the gametes. Through random fertilization, these four different gametes will lead to the characteristic 9:3:3:1 ratio observed by Mendel in his dihybrid crosses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ChromosomeBehaviorandSexChromosomes-LinkingGenesandChromosomes"&gt;Linking Genes and Chromosomes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3099|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the relationship between genes and traits was fairly well accepted by the early 1900's, biologist T. H. Morgan of Columbia University first mapped a gene to a specific chromosome. One of the early pioneers working with fruit flies in genetic studies, Morgan (and his students) discovered one male fly with white eyes, a trait they had not seen in these flies. The phenotype that is prevalent in natural populations (&lt;strong&gt;wild-type&lt;/strong&gt;) for this character is red eyes, so the individual had a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;mutant phenotype&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;for this particular character.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ChromosomeBehaviorandSexChromosomes-NomenclatureUsedbyDrosophilaGeneticists"&gt;Nomenclature Used by&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Geneticists&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assist with his work, Morgan and his students developed a nomenclature system for distinguishing between the normal (wild-type) allele and its variants. This system is still used by&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;geneticists. The gene for a particular character is named for the first mutant phenotype discovered. In the case of eye color, the allele for white eyes was appropriately designated&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;, for "white." The wild-type allele uses the same letter but has a superscript&amp;nbsp;+ . Therefore, the allele for red eyes is symbolized as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;w+&lt;/em&gt;. The white eye allele is then simply&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;w&lt;/em&gt;. The letter identifying the mutant is lowercase if the allele is recessive (as in white eyes), or uppercase for those mutations that are dominant to the wild-type allele. The allele that causes curly wings, a dominant mutation, is symbolized as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Cy&lt;/em&gt;, and the allele that codes for straight wings (wild type) is identified as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Cy+&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sex-linked Genes</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;To investigate the mutant white eye allele, Morgan mated the white-eyed male fly with a red-eyed (wild type) female. As shown in this figure, all of the F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;offspring had red eyes, indicating that the allele for white eyes was recessive. When Morgan bred the F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;generation flies to one another, he observed the classic 3:1 ratio of red:white eyes, however, only males had the mutant trait. All of the females and one-half of the males had the wild-type trait, which led Morgan to hypothesize that the gene that coded for eye color must be related to sex determination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3101|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like humans, female fruit flies have two&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;chromosomes (&lt;em&gt;XX&lt;/em&gt;) and males have one&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and one&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;em&gt;XY&lt;/em&gt;). If the gene for eye color is located on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;chromosome, then this would explain why the trait rarely appears in females (i.e., a female would have to be homozygous for the recessive mutant). However, males would show the mutant trait if they have one copy of the allele because they have only one&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;chromosome and there is no corresponding gene for eye color on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;chromosome. This study demonstrated that the gene for eye color in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;D. melanogaster&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;was located on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;chromosome and provided further evidence for a chromosome theory of heredity. The X and Y chromosomes are called&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;sex chromosomes&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;because they determine the sex of an individual. Genes that are located on these chromosomes are called&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;sex-linked genes&lt;/strong&gt;. All other chromosomes in a cell (i.e., other than the sex chromosomes) are referred to as&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;autosomes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ChromosomeBehaviorandSexChromosomes-SexChromosomesandMeiosis"&gt;Sex Chromosomes and Meiosis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are several different systems for sex determination, for simplicity we will focus on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;X-Y system&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;of sex determination to examine sex-linked inheritance. During meiosis, the two&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;chromosomes (found in females) or the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;chromosomes (found in males) pair together because they have a small region of homology, but undergo little crossing over. One of these chromosomes then goes to each gamete, so females produce gametes with only&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;chromosomes, whereas males produce equal numbers of gametes with either an&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;chromosome. If two gametes with&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;chromosomes undergo fertilization, the resultant offspring will be female (&lt;em&gt;XX&lt;/em&gt;). That is, if an ovum with an X chromosome and a sperm with an X chromosome combine, the resultant offspring will be female. However, if an ovum with an X chromosome and a sperm with a Y chromosome combine, the offspring will be male (&lt;em&gt;XY&lt;/em&gt;). While it has long been known that the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;chromosome contains a substantial number of genes, researchers have only recently found genes on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;chromosome, most of which are associated with the development of male gonads, including the sex determining region of the Y chromosome (&lt;strong&gt;SRY&lt;/strong&gt;) gene in mammals. Therefore, it appears that a gene (or genes) on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;chromosome provides the biochemical signal that begins the development of male gonads in embryos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ChromosomeBehaviorandSexChromosomes-Sex-linkedInheritance"&gt;Sex-linked Inheritance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only do sex chromosomes determine the sex of an individual, but the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;chromosome also has genes that code for many characters that are not related to sex determination. Sex-linked alleles in an XY chromosome system follow the patterns of inheritance observed in Morgan's studies, in which fathers transmit these genes to their daughters, and mothers can transmit them to either sons or daughters. Females will only express recessive sex-linked traits that are homozygous, but males will express the trait coded for by their one&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;chromosome. As a result, sex-linked recessive traits are far more frequent in males than in females, although some females do exhibit sex-linked recessive traits. Since males have only one chromosomal location for sex-linked genes, the terms homozygous and heterozygous have little meaning. By convention, males are said to be&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;hemizygous&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;for sex-linked genes because they have half ("hemi") as many alleles as a female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with autosomal traits, you can utilize the Punnett square to study the transmission of sex-linked traits. When completing these crosses, the gametes identify the sex chromosomes only. The genes located on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;chromosome are indicated with superscript letters. (We will not examine any cases where we track a&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt;-linked gene.) As with Mendelian traits, a lowercase letter indicates a recessive allele, while an uppercase letter indicates a dominant allele. When discussing sex-linked traits, carriers (females who are heterozygous for a recessive trait) need to be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only did Morgan's work bolster a chromosome theory of heredity, it also initiated the study of sex-linked traits. Although the basis of sex determination in humans and fruit flies is similar (&lt;em&gt;XX&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;= female,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;XY&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;= male), the same is not true of all organisms. In this figure the numerals represent the number of autosomes. In some insects sex is determined by the X-O system, in which females have two copies of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;chromosome and males only one. Therefore, the sex of the offspring will be determined by whether or not an&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;chromosome is present in the sperm that fertilizes the ovum. The Z-W system occurs in some birds, insects, and fish. In this system the chromosomes found in the ovum are variable (Z or W) Note: the figure is incorrect and sperm always contribute a&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Z&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;chromosome. Here, it is the female (not the male) that determines the sex of the offspring. Bees and ants display a fourth type of sex determination, the haplo-diploid system. Females develop from fertilized eggs and are diploid, whereas males develop from unfertilized eggs and are haploid.

    <title>Sex-linked Genes in Humans - Color Blindness</title>

&lt;p&gt;Sex-linked traits are not unique to flies; a great many exist for humans. One example is color blindness, in which affected individuals are not able to distinguish certain colors. The genes for both red and green color perception are X-linked and the mutations are recessive; therefore, color blindness affects far more males than females. Color blindness is diagnosed by showing children images like the one on this page. The orange circle is visible to all, but individuals with one form of red-green color blindness are unable to distinguish the red star from the green background.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sex-linked Genes in Humans - Hemophilia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another sex-linked trait in humans is hemophilia. Hemophiliacs (individuals affected with hemophilia) lack a protein involved in blood clotting, so they can bleed profusely from even a minor abrasion. This disease is of particular interest, given its relatively high frequency in many of the royal houses of Europe. It is thought that the hemophilia gene spontaneously mutated in one of Queen Victoria's (a queen of England in the 1800s) parents, making her a carrier of the trait. She transmitted the hemophilia allele to one son and some of her daughters, and it eventually affected the imperial houses of Prussia, Russia, and Spain through a series of politically arranged marriages.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>X-Inactivation</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Typically, females have two X chromosomes, while males have only one; and yet, males undergo normal development. How can this be? The answer lies in an observation that was made by the geneticist Mary Lyon. Female mammals have a dark region located just inside the nucleus, along the nuclear membrane. The object is called a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Barr body&lt;/strong&gt;. The Barr body is an inactivated X chromosome that stays condensed throughout the cell cycle. By inactivated, it is meant that most of the genes on the chromosome are not expressed and cannot be used to make proteins. Therefore, like the cells in males, females have only one functioning X chromosome and they contribute only one dose (copy) of the genes on that chromosome. Inactivation of the X chromosome in females compensates for the extra copy, thereby making the production of proteins in the cells of males and females the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is the X chromosome inactivated in female cells? It is a process that happens early in development, when one of the two X chromosomes in the cells of the embryo becomes inactivated. If there are more than two X chromosomes, the extra X chromosomes also inactivate. &amp;nbsp;It appears to be a random process, with about 50% of the cells inactivating the maternal X and 50% inactivating the paternal X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of inactivation are easily seen in tortoiseshell and calico cats. The gene for orange fur is on the X chromosome in cats. If a cat is heterozygous for the orange allele (O = orange, o = not orange), then random inactivation of the X chromosomes causes patches of orange and not orange (usually black) fur. This is why male calico cats are so rare. They must have an XXY chromosome complement. (This chromosome complement causes Klinefelter syndrome in humans.) In these males, one of the X chromosomes is inactivated and Barr bodies are found in their cells. Because of the presence of the functional Y chromosome, however, these individuals are genetically male.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3109|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gene for the inactivation of the X chromosome, called the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;XIST gene&lt;/strong&gt;, is located on the X chromosome. This gene does not appear to code for a protein. It is one of the few genes expressed on the inactivated X chromosome. The gene is transcribed, producing many copies of an RNA molecule. These RNAs attach to the DNA on the same X chromosome, inactivating it. Scientists are still researching the phenomenon. For example, it is uncertain how cells determine if an X chromosome should be inactivated or not. There is still a lot to learn about X-inactivation in mammals.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Real Life Example:  Retinitis pigmentosa</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Some forms of retinitis pigmentosa (a disease of the photoreceptors and the pigment epithelium of the eye) are X-linked recessive. You search the web and discover there are instances when females are afflicted with this disorder. Your lab partner tells you this proves the trait cannot be X-linked because it should only appear in boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain why your lab partner is incorrect and give a possible reason as to why he misunderstands this mode of transmission.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the probability that a woman with retinitis pigmentosa will have a son with the disease (her partner does not have the disease)? What is the probability she will have a daughter with the disease?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</body>

    <title>Summary</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Previously, we considered the expression pattern of genes that are found on different chromosomes (therefore, they independently assort). However, what is the behavior of genes that are located a particular chromosome? What happens to traits that are found on the sex chromosomes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many sexually reproducing organisms, sex is determined by genes that are located on dissimilar chromosomes. These dissimilar chromosomes are termed sex chromosomes. Humans possess 23 pairs of chromosomes; 22 of these are similar (autosomes), whereas one pair (the X and Y chromosomes) is dissimilar and possesses the genes responsible for the transmission of character traits that determine sex. If an individual has the XX genotype, the individual is female, while the XY genotype results in males. There are two important facts to remember about sex chromosomes. First, the X chromosome is generally larger and has more genes than the Y chromosome. Second, genes that affect traits other than sex are also found on these chromosomes (for example, a gene that affects tooth enamel in humans is found on both the X and the Y).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the above two facts in mind, consider the male genotype (XY). Because the X chromosome has more genes than the Y, not all alleles will be found in the heterozygous state. That is, the maternally derived alleles may be expressed as if they were in the homozygous state. (Remember that the male's X chromosome comes from the mother.) Traits that are disproportionately expressed in one gender (typically males) are termed sex-linked traits. That is, sex-linked traits tend to follow (are linked to) the gender from which they're derived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the following tutorial, we will examine the relationship of genes that are located on the same autosome.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h3 id="ChromosomeBehaviorandGeneLinkage-IntroductionandLearningObjectives"&gt;Introduction and Learning Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously we examined the relationship between gene segregation and meiosis. As you should now know, Mendel was able to infer independent assortment between different genes because they were located on different chromosomes (each of which assorts randomly during meiosis). We also mentioned that genes located on the same chromosome may segregate together because they are linked. Next, you will learn why they may, or may not, segregate together. Moreover, you will learn how the frequency at which they become unlinked can be used to construct a genetic map of each chromosome. By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why genes are linked&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How genes become separated by crossing over during prophase I&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The stochastic nature of crossing over&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How crossover frequency can be used to map genes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How meiotic recombination and independent assortment contribute to generational variation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance Objectives:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review the events in meiosis that result in the independent assortment of genes, and the phenomenon of crossing over&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the relationship of the distance between genes on the same chromosome and the frequency of crossing over between the genes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Calculate the recombination frequency between linked genes based upon the frequency of offspring phenotypes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use the recombination frequency between genes to map genes to a chromosome&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain how the position of genes on a chromosome can affect the recombination frequency&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discuss how some genes may be completely linked and not assort independently&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Summary</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;This tutorial examined the consequences of gene linkage and how crossing over in meiosis can alter the segregation pattern of genes that are located on the same chromosome. During Prophase I, homologous chromosomes pair up, gene-for-gene. Occasionally this pairing leads to breakage and rejoining of regions of homologous chromosomes. In other words, portions of a maternally derived chromatid can exchange and become physically connected with regions of a paternally derived chromatid (and vice-versa). Any gene located on either side of this &amp;nbsp;break point will become unlinked. The absolute point where crossover occurs cannot be predicted with certainty (although some regions of the chromosome are more prone to this than others); however, the greater the distance that two genes are from one another on the same chromosome, the greater the likelihood that crossing over will occur between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the probability for crossing over increases proportionately with the distance between two linked genes, then the frequency at which they become unlinked (due to crossovers) is an indirect measure of how far apart these genes are from one another. If you don't understand why this is so, you might find it helpful to draw a couple of cartoons of chromosomes with two hypothetical genes at different distances from one another. Draw one set with the two genes 1/2 inch apart, and the other set with them one inch apart. If, on average, a crossover occurs once every four inches, then 25% of the time the two genes located one inch apart will become unlinked. However, the two genes located 1/2 inch apart will only become unlinked 12.5% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relationship between gene distance and recombination frequency can be used to map the relative location of a gene on a chromosome. Be sure that you understand the logic behind this process that allows geneticists to map the relative order of genes on a chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Using Cross Over Frequencies to Map Genes</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Alfred H. Sturtevant hypothesized that the frequency at which linked genes become unlinked through crossing over (&lt;strong&gt;recombination frequencies&lt;/strong&gt;; calculated from experiments similar to the one in the figure below) could be used to determine the distances between genes on a chromosome. He predicted that the farther apart two genes were on a particular chromosome, the higher the probability that crossing over would occur between them, and subsequently, a higher recombination frequency would be observed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3123|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By considering a chromosome a linear sequence of genes, Sturtevant assigned each gene he was studying in fruit fly crosses a position on the chromosome using recombination frequencies. &amp;nbsp;The figure below&amp;nbsp;illustrates one of Sturtevant's genetic maps, where three genes that are linked to each other (body color (&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;), wing size (&lt;em&gt;vg&lt;/em&gt;) and an eye color gene called cinnabar (&lt;em&gt;cn&lt;/em&gt;)) are positioned based on recombination frequencies determined through test crosses. This type of genetic map is called a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;linkage map&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;because it portrays the sequence of genes along a chromosome, but it does not give the precise location of the genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the distance between two genes, Sturtevant divided the number of gametes with recombinant chromosomes by the total number of gametes observed. In the figure above, the recombination frequency between&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;cn&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is 9%, and the recombination frequency between&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;cn&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;vg&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is 9.5%. Therefore, crossovers between&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;cn&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;, and between&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;cn&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;vg&lt;/em&gt;, are about half as frequent as crossovers between&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;vg&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(17%). A map that places&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;cn&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;between&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;vg&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(approximately half-way) is consistent with these observations. Sturtevant expressed the distance between genes in&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;map units&lt;/strong&gt;. By definition, one map unit (1 m.u.) is equivalent to a 1% recombination frequency. In honor of Morgan, one map unit, or a 1% frequency, is also called one centimorgan (cM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3125|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3127|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, using crossover data, Sturtevant and his coworkers mapped other&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;genes in linear arrays at particular genetic locations. The figure above&amp;nbsp;shows an abbreviated genetic map of chromosome II in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with many rules, there are exceptions. The maximum recombination frequency that can be calculated between two genes is 49%.&amp;nbsp; Once two genes are 50 map units apart, or further, the number of recombinant offspring produced will&amp;nbsp;be equal to the number of offspring with the parental phenotypes.&amp;nbsp; These genes would appear to assort independently and may mistakenly be thought to be located on different chromosomes because they are far enough apart on their chromosome that linkage is not observed in genetic crosses. These genes are mapped by adding the recombination frequencies from crosses involving intermediate genes, and by determining the approximate distance of each gene from the intermediates. For example, the genes for black body and brown eyes are move than 50 map units apart, so if you performed a test cross you would see a 1:1:1:1 ratio of phenotypes in the offspring. &amp;nbsp;However, the genes for vestigial wings and cinnabar eyes are between these two genes at a distance of less than 50 map units, and you can to crosses to determine the recombination frequency between those genes and either black body or brown eyes, allowing you to construct a linkage map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genes that are close enough together on the same chromosome that they never recombine (cross-over) are described as being &lt;strong&gt;completely linked&lt;/strong&gt;. &amp;nbsp;The map distance between completely linked genes is 0.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Evidence for Linked Genes in Drosophila</title>

&lt;p&gt;This figure demonstrates a test cross between flies differing in two characters: body color (&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;) and wing size (&lt;em&gt;vg&lt;/em&gt;). If you do not remember &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; gene nomenclature, go back and review the information in the tutorial on sex-linked genes. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The female&amp;nbsp;is heterozygous at both genes and her phenotype&amp;nbsp;is wild type, so she has a gray body&amp;nbsp;and normal wings (&lt;em&gt;b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;b vg&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;vg&lt;/em&gt;). The male&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;homozygous recessive and expresses the mutant phenotypes for both characteristics, black body&amp;nbsp;and vestigial wings (&lt;em&gt;b b vg vg&lt;/em&gt;). When T.H. Morgan scored this particular experiment and classified the offspring according to phenotype, he found that the parental phenotypes were disproportionately represented among offspring. If the two characters were on different chromosomes and assorted independently, Morgan would have expected to see a ratio of recombinant phenotypes to parental phenotypes of 1:1:1:1. Yet Morgan's observation of disproportionate offspring led him to conclude that the genes for body color and wing size in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;were usually transmitted together from parents to offspring because they were located on the same chromosome. Therefore, the black body color gene and the vestigial wing gene are linked. This means these genes are located close to one another on the same chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Test Your Understanding: Crossing Over and Recombination of Alleles</title>

&lt;p&gt;Crossing-over in meiosis is typically described as a random event and for genes that&amp;nbsp;reside on most areas of the chromosomes this is a true statement. However, it is observed&amp;nbsp;that the crossing-over process becomes suppressed as one examines genes that lie&amp;nbsp;progressively closer to the centromere (i.e., that region of the chromosome where sister&amp;nbsp;chromatids remain attached until the onset of Anaphase II). Consider four genes in a heterozygotous state that lie on the same chromosome prior to the onset of&amp;nbsp;meiosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you examine the gametes of individuals having this arrangement, would you&amp;nbsp;expect to see a higher proportion of gametes with AB compared to CD? Why or&amp;nbsp;why not?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a cross-over takes place at the location indicated with an arrow, what are the&amp;nbsp;possible gametes that can be produced?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</body>

    <title>Pairing at Prophase I</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Chromosomes are linear pieces of DNA that are highly folded and compacted (DNA Packaging). &amp;nbsp;If all of the DNA strands from each of your 46 chromosomes (23 pairs) were &amp;nbsp;joined end to end, the DNA would stretch about 2 meters. Therefore, DNA molecules must be highly organized and compacted to fit into the nucleus of a single cell.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3115|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you learned in the Carbon and Life tutorial, DNA is a double-stranded molecule, containing two antiparallel strands of nucleotides arranged in the form of a double helix. The two strands are held together by hydrogen bonds and contain nitrogenous bases (nucleotides) paired in a complementary way that appear as "rungs" on a spiral ladder. The complementary nucleotides pair specifically, such that adenine and guanine nucleotides, the purines (A and G) pair with corresponding thymine and cytosine nucleotides, the pyrimidines (T and C); A pairs with T, and G pairs with C. &amp;nbsp;The figure at right&amp;nbsp;depicts this in two ways. The image on the left clearly shows the base-pairing rules, whereas the image on the right depicts the helical arrangement of the paired polynucleotide strands.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homologous chromosomes have similar nucleotide sequences but they are not identical. Indeed, it is these subtle differences in nucleotide sequences that form the molecular identity of alternative alleles for a given gene. During Prophase I, homologous chromosomes pair together due to their similarity in structure, length, and gene sequence. This sets up a physical association, synapsis, that enables the exchange of genetic sequences (i.e., pieces of DNA) between homologous chromosomes through crossing over.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ChromosomeBehaviorandGeneLinkage-CrossingOverProducesRecombinantChromosomes"&gt;Crossing Over Produces Recombinant Chromosomes
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pairing of homologous chromosomes at Prophase I is different than the pairing that occurs between complementary strands of DNA., The DNA of nonsister chromatids becomes precisely aligned when the synaptonemal&amp;nbsp;complex is formed. When the homologs pair, both a maternal copy and a paternal copy of genetic information line up against each other. While the chromosomes are in synapsis, the two homologs may swap genetic material in a process called&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;crossing over.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;
  &lt;br&gt;This process is a source of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;genetic recombination&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and produces&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;recombinant chromosomes&lt;/strong&gt;. That is, a piece of a maternal chromatid exchanges with a piece of the paternal chromatid on the homologous chromosome. There can be multiple crossovers between the nonsister chromatids of homologous chromosomes. Furthermore, crossover configurations can occur in any combination and can lead to different outcomes. Recall, crossing over was introduced in the tutorial on Meiosis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3117|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only two nonsister chromatids are involved in any single crossover event, and crossing over occurs at different points along the chromosome during each meiosis. Every meiotic process does not involve crossing over in the same set of genes each time, but there is at least one crossover per homologous pair. Still, when crossing over is observed in a meiotic division, up to half of the products of that division result in a recombination of DNA between the homologs, producing novel chromosomes. This recombination means the homologs are now different than the parental chromosomes, therefore, each may carry &amp;nbsp;different &amp;nbsp;genetic information.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
  &lt;br&gt;View this animation to observe how recombinants arise from crossing over between genes on nonsister chromatids:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;gene-crossover&gt;
&lt;/gene-crossover&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ChromosomeBehaviorandGeneLinkage-CrossingOverisMainlyRandom"&gt;Crossing Over is Mainly Random
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many factors affect crossing over, &amp;nbsp;and the position on the chromosome where crossing over will occur is unpredictable. Crossing over is a random event. While the location of the break points on the DNA sequence of the chromosomes are &amp;nbsp;fairly random, the recombination frequency is relatively constant between homologous chromosomes. (For a given chromosome, N number of &amp;nbsp;cross overs will occur, but where they will occur is random.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probability of crossing over between genes on a chromosome is dependent on the distances between the genes. This shouldn't surprise you because the greater the distance between two genes, the greater the chance a break will occur.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genes that are located on the same chromosome and that tend to be inherited together are &amp;nbsp;called&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;linked genes&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;because the DNA sequence containing the genes is passed along as a unit during meiosis unless they are separated by crossing over. The closer together that genes &amp;nbsp;are located on a particular chromosome, the higher the probability that they will be inherited as a unit, since crossing over between two linked genes is less frequent the closer together the two genes are (genes with&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;complete linkage&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;are close enough together on a chromosome that they never recombine and are always inherited as a unit).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, linked genes do not follow the expected inheritance patterns predicted by Mendel's Theory of Independent Assortment when observed across several generations of crosses. For two heterozygous genes that are unlinked and undergoing independent assortment, you expect to see parental and recombinant gametes in a ratio of 1:1:1:1.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When two genes are linked on a chromosome,crossing over between the two genes will be less common than having no crossing over, so fewer recombinant chromosomes will be produced. Under this circumstance, a ratio that deviates from the usual 1:1:1:1 will be observed, indicating that the genes are linked. &amp;nbsp;The number of parental genotypes in the gametes will be higher and the number of recombinant genotypes will be lower.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    <title>Historical Background</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;While at Columbia University in 1909, a young undergraduate student Alfred Henry Sturtevant&amp;nbsp;took a class from Dr. Thomas H. Morgan, the famous geneticist who first described the relationship between genes and chromosomes. Sturtevant decided to continue in this line of study due to his life-long interest in genetics. Sturtevant's interest had been fostered by his work on inheritance patterns of coat color in horses; he had spent his youth tabulating the pedigrees of his father's horses and studying the passing of color traits from one generation to the next. Sturtevant approached the distinguished professor and asked for a research position in Morgan's laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3113|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3110|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrigued by Sturtevant's work on coat color inheritance (which he later encouraged Alfred to publish in the Biological Bulletin; c. 1910), Morgan offered Sturtevant a desk and research project, in what later became known as "Morgan's Fly Room." Morgan had recently begun working with a relatively new model system for genetic analysis, the fruit fly&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/em&gt;. Together with Calvin Bridges and H.J. Muller, Sturtevant became a member of Morgan's lab at a time when the focus of the lab was shifting away from the study of development and embryology in marine invertebrates to the genetics of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sturtevant was fascinated by his work in the "Fly Room." Over the course of his undergraduate research he spent hours talking about inheritance with his colleagues. One night, after a lengthy discussion about a paper describing coat color inheritance in rabbits, Sturtevant deduced that genes were linked in a series. He was so energized about his idea that he stayed up late that evening constructing experiments that would later demonstrate his theory and provide the basis of linkage analysis. Sturtevant's work (as well as that of his lab mates) was a key component to the demonstration of the chromosome theory of heredity published by Morgan's group. Sturtevant continued his research as a graduate student in the lab, where he published the first&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;genetic map&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;of a chromosome as part of his graduate dissertation in 1913. Still, chromosome theory would not be definitively proven until after the Second World War. Sturtevant had a long career studying the genetics of fruit flies.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>DNA Replication</title>
    <body>&lt;h3 id="DNAReplication-IntroductionandLearningObjectives"&gt;Introduction and Learning Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson and Crick concluded their 1953 paper on the structure of DNA with the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3129|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The "specific pairing" they mentioned is the hydrogen-bonds between adenine and thymine, and guanine and cytosine. The "copying mechanism" is DNA replication, a simple yet accurate series of steps by which DNA carries the instructions for its own reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will cover the process of DNA replication.&amp;nbsp; Remember, every time a cell divides - it must replicate its DNA. By the end of the tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When DNA replication takes place&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Where DNA replication takes place&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How DNA replication takes place&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What happens if there is a mistake during DNA replication&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance Objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compare and contrast the structures of DNA and RNA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diagram the process of DNA replication, including all of the enzymes and molecules that are necessary&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the antiparallel structure of a DNA molecule and the implications this has for DNA replication&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain the different DNA repair mechanisms and the different possible types of mutations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain how PCR is used to amplify a gene&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</body>

    <title>Summary</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;This tutorial examined the process of DNA replication. This process is pivotal to life, so it will be important that you have a firm grasp on the basic aspects of DNA replication (i.e., to the level presented in this tutorial).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All cells that divide need to replicate their DNA so that each daughter cell contains a full complement of all the parent's genetic information. In the process of replication, the two strands are replicated with remarkable fidelity. To appreciate this process, keep a couple of things in mind. First, DNA is comprised of two antiparallel strands. The polarity of each strand is due to the manner in which the nucleotides are linked together. Second, DNA is synthesized in only one direction; 5' to 3'. Be sure that you understand that one strand is synthesized continuously, and that the other is synthesized discontinuously. Be sure that you understand why this is so, and be sure that you are familiar with the basic steps involved in this process.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Errors during DNA Replication result in Mutations</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;In spite of the rules of base-pairing, sometimes mistakes are made during DNA replication. Mistakes occur about once in every 10,000 base pairs and can potentially be disastrous for an organism. There are various repair mechanisms that can fix these errors and, in the end, the observed error rate is very low (often less than one mistake/10 million bases).&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Mismatch repair&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;occurs when DNA polymerase and other proofreading enzymes remove incorrectly paired nucleotides.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Excision repair&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;involves the removal of damaged nucleotides from a DNA molecule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these repair mechanisms are not successful, mutations occur. A&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;mutation&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a permanent change in an organism's DNA. If the mutation occurs in a reproductive cell, the mutation can be passed to future generations and potentially become established in a population (this is why mutations are the ultimate source of genetic variation in populations). The effect that a mutation has on an organism depends upon whether or not the mutation occurs in a gene and, if it does occur in a gene, how much it changes the resulting protein. Therefore, mutations can be harmful (e.g., sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis), beneficial (e.g., antibiotic resistance), or neutral (a neutral mutation occurs when an organism's DNA sequence changes but this change has no effect on the organism's phenotype).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3532|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of enzymes that help defend against mutations are specific DNA polymerases that fix errors that occur in DNA as a result of exposure to UV radiation (sunlight). One type of damage that UV radiation causes in DNA is the creation of thymine dimers. Thymine dimers result when two thymine bases are next to each other in a DNA strand and they covalently bond to each other instead of hydrogen bond to the adenine on the complementary strand. &amp;nbsp;If this error occurs in part of the DNA that regulates the cell cycle, skin cancer can result. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is an autosomal recessive genetic condition that occurs as a result of a mutation to one of seven different DNA polymerases that repair UV-damaged DNA. The affected individual has a decreased ability to repair UV-induced mutations and the resulting damage is cumulative and irreversible. These individuals must stay away from sunlight and are sometimes referred to as "Children of the Night". People with XP begin developing skin cancers in childhood and life expectancy is significantly decreased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DNA Replication</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Each time a cell divides, it must replicate its DNA. The replication of DNA takes place during the S-phase of the cell cycle&amp;nbsp;and results in a chromosome that is comprised of two identical sister chromatids. DNA replication can be divided into several stages. The DNA double helix unwinds and nitrogenous bases (A,T,G or C) are added to each strand of the parent molecule (but only onto one end of each), resulting in two identical copies of the original parent strands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3134|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3136|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA replication is termed &lt;strong&gt;semiconservative&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;replication&lt;/strong&gt; because each newly formed molecule of DNA has one strand conserved from the parent molecule and one newly synthesized strand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an animation of an overview of DNA replication: &lt;dnareplication-overview&gt;&lt;/dnareplication-overview&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along a strand of DNA, replication begins at numerous&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;origins of replication&lt;/strong&gt;. There are several enzymes involved in the process of DNA replication.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Helicases&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;unwind the DNA double helix,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;single-strand binding proteins&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;keep the strands separate while&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;primases&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;initiate replication, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;DNA polymerase&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;adds nucleotides to the unwound parent molecule. While the fundamentals of replication are simple, there is a feature of DNA structure that makes things a bit more complicated; the strands have opposite chemical polarities. This can be hard to comprehend because the strands seem identical. However, a close inspection reveals that the H-bonding that occurs between bases is only achieved if the strands have opposite polarities. This arrangement of strands is&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;antiparallel&lt;/strong&gt;, with one strand designated the 3'-to-5' strand and the other the 5'-to-3' strand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3138|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3140|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;DNA polymerase has an important limitation - it can&amp;nbsp;&lt;u&gt;only&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;add nucleotides to the 3' end of the newly synthesized strand of DNA. Therefore, nucleotide addition is a smooth, continuous process along one of the strands (the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;leading strand&lt;/strong&gt;) of DNA. The other strand (the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;lagging strand&lt;/strong&gt;) has a discontinuous mode of replication because DNA polymerase can only work by starting from the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;replication fork&lt;/strong&gt;(where DNA is unwinding) and progressing outward (until it runs into a previously synthesized fragment). An added wrinkle to the process on the lagging strand is created by the lack of a continuous new strand; DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to an existing 3' nucleotide. How is this lagging strand started? Primase has the ability to synthesize a short&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;primer&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;made of a few nucleotides of RNA. DNA polymerase can then add DNA nucleotides to the end of this primer sequence and synthesize relatively short stretches of DNA known as&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Okazaki fragments&lt;/strong&gt;. An additional enzyme (&lt;strong&gt;ligase&lt;/strong&gt;) seals the fragments into a continuous strand of DNA. The figure above&amp;nbsp;provides an overview of the enzymes involved, antiparallelism, and the overall direction of DNA replication. All of this takes place in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells (cells that have membrane-bound nuclei and organelles). Be sure that you study this figure carefully. You could see this figure unlabeled and be asked to name the enzymes and their functions on an exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;This is an animation of the steps of DNA replication:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Polymerase Chain Reaction</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Imagine that you are a forensics investigator and you have been called to a crime scene to look for any potential evidence a criminal may have left behind. &amp;nbsp;You carefully analyze the scene of the crime and find a single drop of blood on the windowsill where the culprit cut himself while breaking the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can you do with this single drop of blood?&amp;nbsp; If you have enough DNA, you can create a DNA fingerprint that may allow you to identify the person responsible for the crime.&amp;nbsp; But a single drop of blood does not contain enough DNA to create a fingerprint.&amp;nbsp; What can you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is to use PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) to amplify (or make many copies of) the DNA.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCR is a laboratory technique that uses the basic steps and materials of DNA replication to create a large number of copies of a small piece&amp;nbsp;of DNA in a short period of time (PCR cannot be used to copy entire chromosomes).&amp;nbsp; Invented in 1983 by Kerry Mullis (who won the Nobel Prize for his invention in 1993), PCR has revolutionized the study of biology and its applications.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCR involves using a machine called a thermocycler to repeatedly heat and copy a segment of DNA.&amp;nbsp; Added to the thermocycler are the template DNA, specific DNA primers, DNA polymerase, and DNA nucleotides (along with some other chemicals that help the reactions run).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3535|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic steps of PCR are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.&amp;nbsp; &lt;u&gt;Denaturation&lt;/u&gt;:&amp;nbsp; the DNA is heated to separate the two complimentary strands (note that in a cell helicase would play this role).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.&amp;nbsp; &lt;u&gt;Annealing&lt;/u&gt;:&amp;nbsp; the temperature is lowered and the DNA primers attach (or anneal) to the regions around the segment of DNA to be copied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.&amp;nbsp; &lt;u&gt;Elongation&lt;/u&gt;:&amp;nbsp; DNA polymerase copies the template segment of DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.&amp;nbsp; &lt;u&gt;Repeat the process:&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp; The process is repeated until the desired amount of DNA is obtained.&amp;nbsp; In a few hours, millions of copies of a piece of DNA can be created.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest generations of this technology were relatively slow and labor intensive because the denaturation stage would destroy the DNA polymerase (DNA polymerase, like all proteins, is heat sensitive).&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;A technician would need to add new DNA polymerase after each heating cycle.&amp;nbsp; However, in 1976 biologists had discovered a heat resistant DNA polymerase from a bacterium that lives in hot springs (&lt;em&gt;Thermus aquaticus&lt;/em&gt;).&amp;nbsp; This DNA polymerase is now referred to as &lt;em&gt;Taq&lt;/em&gt; polymerase and its use in PCR has made the process faster and less labor intensive because the &lt;em&gt;Taq&lt;/em&gt; polymerase survives the heating cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet another example of biodiversity playing an important role in improving human lives!&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Summary</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The process of RNA transcription has some similarities to DNA replication (e.g., synthesis occurs in the 5' to 3' direction), but it also has some important differences. First, only one strand of DNA is used as a template for RNA synthesis. Second, ribonucleotides are used instead of deoxyribonucleotides. Finally, not all DNA in a genome is transcribed at once. Rather, via the action of transcription factors and gene regulation, only selected genes are transcribed at a given time. Be sure that you understand the basic aspects of this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein translation is the process by which messenger RNA (mRNA) supplies the necessary information for the synthesis of proteins. There are three basic components to a cell's translational machinery: mRNA, tRNA, and ribosomes. Messenger RNA provides the template that will be used for ordering the correct sequence of amino acids. Fidelity of the translational process is assured, in part, by the fact that each amino acid has its own transfer RNA. Transfer RNA (tRNA) is found with an appropriate amino acid. For example, a tRNA that has an anticodon of "UAC" will bind to the triplet on the mRNA with the complimentary sequence "AUG." Thus, each tRNA delivers the appropriate amino acid to the ribosome; ordering of amino acids is determined by the linear arrangement of the genetic code. Be sure that you understand the relationship between these three components of the cell's translational machinery.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>A Real Life Example:  The mutation responsible for Cystic Fibrosis</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) is the gene that causes the genetic&amp;nbsp;condition Cystic Fibrosis (CF). The normal CFTR gene codes for an ion channel protein that regulates the&amp;nbsp;movement of chloride ions across the cell membrane. The most common mutant allele (ΔF508) codes for&amp;nbsp;a defective protein that does not get established in the cell membrane and thus cannot regulate the proper&amp;nbsp;movement of chloride ions. The result is the buildup of a thick mucus layer in the lungs that allows for&amp;nbsp;frequent bacterial infections. Left untreated, CF is a lethal condition. The coding regions of the CFTR gene are over 250,000 base pairs (250 kb) long. The ΔF508 mutation is&amp;nbsp;located approximately 15,000 base pairs into the coding region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The normal allele has, as part of its sequence along the coding strand (not the template strand), the&lt;br&gt;nucleotides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;5’ AATATCATCTTTGGTGTTTCC 3’&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ΔF508 allele has along the coding strand the corresponding sequence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;5’ AATATCATCGGTGTTTCC 3’&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• First, determine the mRNA sequences that are transcribed from both the normal and the ΔF508&amp;nbsp;allele.&lt;br&gt;• Next, use the genetic code below to determine the amino acid sequences that both alleles encode.&lt;br&gt;• What is the specific mutation in the ΔF508 allele?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gene To Protein: Gene Regulation</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;During sexual reproduction in many organisms, such as humans, a sperm fertilizes an egg to produce a zygote. This zygote then begins to divide via mitosis to produce genetically identical daughter cells. Eventually these genetically identical cells will differentiate into different cell and tissue types. &amp;nbsp;This process of cell differentiation is the result of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;gene regulation&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(gene regulation describes how genes are "turned on" and "turned off"). &amp;nbsp;In each cell type, only certain genes are expressed (in fact, in most human cells only 3-5% of genes are expressed). &amp;nbsp;This control of gene expression is due, in part, to the appropriate binding of transcription factors to the promoter region of a gene. &amp;nbsp;When the transcription factor binds to the promoter, it starts the process of gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FromGenetoProtein-Mutations"&gt;Mutations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;mutation&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a change in the nucleotide sequence of a cell. &amp;nbsp;Many of the genetic diseases you learned about in the genetics tutorials are the result of a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;point mutation&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(a change in a single nucleotide). &amp;nbsp;For example, sickle cell anemia is the result of a single base-pair substitution that replaces a thymine with an adenine. &amp;nbsp;The result is a change in the amino acid sequence of hemoglobin where a glutamic acid (a hydrophilic amino acid) is replaced with a valine (a hydrophobic amino acid).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additions and deletions of nucleotides can result in mutations known as "&lt;strong&gt;frameshift mutations&lt;/strong&gt;" because they throw off the reading frame of the genetic message. &amp;nbsp;Frameshift mutations often result in a completely nonfunctional protein and are thus often significantly more damaging than a point mutation. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Gene To Protein: Translation Ingredients</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3147|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to mRNA, two other types of RNA are needed for protein synthesis. These are&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;ribosomal RNA&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;strong&gt;rRNA&lt;/strong&gt;) and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;transfer RNA&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;strong&gt;tRNA&lt;/strong&gt;). Ribosomal RNA combines with proteins to form ribosomes; the cellular structures where the synthesis of polypeptides occurs. Ribosomes consist of two subunits: one large and one small. tRNA molecules transport amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain. Each tRNA molecule has an amino acid attachment site for a particular amino acid and an&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;anticodon&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(a sequence of three nucleotides that is complementary to a sequence of bases in the mRNA strand).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enzyme aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase ensures that a given tRNA molecule picks up only its specific amino acid. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase contains sites that bind amino acids and tRNA, and energy is required to bring these raw materials together. &amp;nbsp;To ensure high fidelity of protein translation, each tRNA has a corresponding aminoacyl-tRNA.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FromGenetoProtein-GeneToProtein:Translation"&gt;Gene To Protein: Translation
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like transcription, translation takes place in three stages: initiation, elongation, and termination.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initiation: In initiation, mRNA binds to the small subunit of a ribosome. An initiation codon, AUG, binds with an initiator tRNA molecule that bears the anticodon UAC and the amino acid methionine. Then a large ribosomal subunit attaches, making the initiation complex complete and allowing translation to begin.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;
  &lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3158|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3160|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three attachment sites on a ribosome. The E site is the exit site, the P site is the peptidyl-tRNA binding site, and the A site is aminoacyl-tRNA binding site.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elongation: In the elongation stage, the polypeptide grows by addition of amino acids according to the sequence of bases in the mRNA molecule. This is accomplished through codon recognition, peptide bond formation, and translocation. A tRNA molecule carrying the appropriate amino acid binds to the A-site, and a peptide bond forms between the new amino acid and the end of the growing polypeptide. Then the complex shifts down the mRNA molecule: the P-site tRNA is bumped to the E-site, where it dissociates from the ribosome; the A-site tRNA moves into the P-site; and a new aminoacyl-tRNA attaches to the now open A-site.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Termination: Elongation continues until a mRNA&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;stop codon&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;reaches the A-site of the ribosome. Stop codons include UAA, UAG and UGA, and they do not code for an amino acid. Instead of a tRNA, a&amp;nbsp;release factor protein&amp;nbsp;binds to the stop codon and the newly synthesized polypeptide is liberated from the ribosome.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newly synthesized polypeptide will undergo coiling and folding to form its secondary and tertiary structures, and it may combine with additional polypeptide chains to achieve quaternary structure (protein structure was discussed in the "Carbon and Life" tutorial).
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gene To Protein: Transcription</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The production of a protein takes place in two stages. &amp;nbsp; First, one of the two strands of DNA is transcribed (or copied) into a single strand of complementary RNA termed&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;messenger RNA&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;strong&gt;mRNA&lt;/strong&gt;). As you should now understand, the mRNA is complementary only to the template strand of DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of transcription occurs in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells and requires that the two strands of DNA separate, or open up sufficiently enough so that mRNA can be produced. The enzyme&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;RNA polymerase&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;separates the DNA strands and joins the RNA nucleotides along the exposed DNA template strand. This process is initiated when certain proteins, known as&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;transcription factors&lt;/strong&gt;, bind to the starting point of a gene. &amp;nbsp;This starting point is known as a "&lt;strong&gt;promoter"&lt;/strong&gt;. The promoter is a sequence of DNA bases that signals the beginning of RNA synthesis. RNA polymerase II adds nucleotides to the 3' end of the elongating RNA molecule. The enzyme moves down the DNA strand, unwinding as it goes and allowing the DNA helix to reform after a sequence has been transcribed. This continues until a DNA sequence, known as a "&lt;strong&gt;terminator sequence"&lt;/strong&gt;, signals the end of RNA synthesis. Transcription is broken down into three stages: initiation, elongation, and termination. &amp;nbsp;At the end of transcription a molecule of mRNA has been produced that carries the instructions for synthesizing a protein. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gene To Protein: The Central Dogma</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3143|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central dogma (prevailing theme) of molecular biology is: DNA is transcribed into messenger RNA, and messenger RNA is translated into proteins. In other words, DNA codes for the synthesis of proteins. This is accomplished via two processes:&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;transcription&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;translation&lt;/strong&gt;. First, one of the DNA strands (the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;template strand&lt;/strong&gt;) is used as a template to make messenger RNA (mRNA). &amp;nbsp;This molecule of mRNA is complementary to the template strand of the DNA molecule and is identical (except for the substitution of uracil for thymine) to the other strand (known as the "&lt;strong&gt;coding strand"&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transcription occurs in the nucleus of eukaryotes, and the mRNA must leave the nucleus and associate with a ribosome to begin the translation of a protein. &amp;nbsp;This figure outlines these steps, along with where they occur in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Note that because prokaryotes do not have a nucleus, proteins can be translated from mRNA immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FromGenetoProtein-GeneToProtein:TheTripletCode"&gt;Gene To Protein: The Triplet Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3147|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the sequence of nucleotides (adenines, guanines, cytosines, and thymines) in a DNA molecule that determines the type of protein that is synthesized. However, there are four possible bases and twenty possible amino acids that join to form a polypeptide chain, so one base cannot code for one amino acid; that scenario would yield only four possibilities. A two-base code would provide only sixteen possibilities; a minimum of three bases is needed to specify a particular amino acid. In 1961, Marshall Nirenberg "cracked" the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;genetic code&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;by determining the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;codon&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;(sequence of bases) that specifies the amino acid phenylalanine. The amino acids lysine, glycine and proline followed, and now the sequence of bases that codes for each of the amino acids found in proteins is known.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The genetic code is used by almost all organisms on earth. &amp;nbsp;mRNA codons code for either amino acids or stop codons. &amp;nbsp;Notice that the codon AUG &amp;nbsp;codes for the amino acid methionine and is also a start codon. &amp;nbsp;The AUG codon signals to the protein translation machinery to begin translating the mRNA at that location. &amp;nbsp; While every newly synthesized protein begins with the amino acid methionine, enzymes may remove the methionine during the final processing of the protein.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3149|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because most organisms on earth use this code, the genetic code is considered "universal" and indicates a common origin to life on earth. &amp;nbsp;The genetic code is also&amp;nbsp;"unambiguous" and "redundant." Unambiguous means that the codons are fixed and that each codon specifies one amino acid. For example, ACC codes for tryptophan and nothing else. However, codons may be redundant, meaning that several codons may code for the same amino acid. For example, CAA, CAC, CAG, and CAT all code for a single amino acid (valine). &amp;nbsp;This redundancy provides protection against the detrimental effects of mutation as will be discussed later in this tutorial. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Population Genetics and Evolution</title>
    <body>&lt;h3 id="PopulationGeneticsandEvolution-IntroductionandLearningObjectives"&gt;Introduction and Learning Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, we have talked about the behavior of genes that are passed from one generation to the next, focusing on the genotypes and phenotypes of individuals. Now we'll take a broader look at genetics and see how the genetics of populations are studied. As you will learn, evolutionary change takes place through changes in the genetic composition of a population. The field of population genetics spans the disciplines of genetics and evolution. By the end of this tutorial you should have a working understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The definition of a population&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How genetic variation in a population is studied&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Hardy-Weinberg equation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The factors that influence changes in allele frequencies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How the founder effect and bottleneck effect relate to genetic drift&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How gene flow, mutations, and mating behavior can affect genetic stability&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How selection can influence allele frequency&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance Objectives&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the assumptions of a population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apply the appropriate Hardy-Weinberg equations (allele and genotype frequencies) to solve population genetics problems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain how the factors that can cause a population to move away from HW equilibrium lead to evolution&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe&amp;nbsp;how both a population bottleneck and a founder event can lead to genetic drift, and its effect on allele frequencies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe how mutation can be a source of new alleles in a population, and why some mutations can be neutral, rather than harmful or beneficial&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Illustrate how migration can affect the genetic structure of a population&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain why non-random mating can change the genotype frequencies in a population, but not the allele frequencies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</body>

    <title>Summary</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;This tutorial covered the basic principles of population genetics. A population is a group of organisms that are members of the same biological species and that live in the same geographic area. Characters in a population can be monomorphic, showing no variation, or polymorphic, having at least two different variants. Variation can be caused by the organism's genotype or by environmental effects. The Hardy-Weinberg equation can be used to examine genetic variation within populations. In the case of two alleles for a gene, the sum of the frequency of the alleles equals 1 or 100%. This is represented by the equation p + q = 1. To determine the frequencies of the three possible genotypes, use the equation p&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ 2pq + q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 1. When the allele frequencies stay the same between generations, the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium requires that allele frequencies within a population remain the same from one generation to the next, as long as certain conditions (including no mutation, large population size, no migration, random mating, and no natural selection) are met. The next tutorial will explore the evolutionary forces that can cause changes in allele and/or genotype frequencies in a population; that is, changes that lead to evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hardy-Weinberg equation can be used to determine the allele frequency in a population. Thus, it provides a useful tool to describe the degree of evolution that is taking place over successive generations. Not all populations are undergoing evolution at all times. In certain stable environments, many populations show no evidence for evolution. (Although if the conditions change, then evolution can take place.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of conditions that predictably decrease evolution; namely: large populations that are more genetically stable compared to smaller populations; no migration/immigration by which new alleles are introduced or removed from a population; no mutations to introduce new alleles; random mating that allows all individuals equal access to all alleles and; no natural selection, which causes changes in allele frequencies due to fitness differences between individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, opposing conditions increase evolution; namely: small populations are genetically unstable because they are susceptible to genetic drift; migration/immigration that allows alleles to enter or leave a population; mutations that introduce new alleles; nonrandom matings that cause unequal access to all alleles; and natural selection that changes allele frequencies based upon individuals' reproductive capacity and fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will look more specifically at natural selection in the next tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Gene Flow</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Populations remain genetically stable if no alleles enter or leave the population. Recall, a change in allele frequencies due to interactions with outside populations is termed gene flow. If a population was fixed for one allele at a &amp;nbsp;gene and a gamete carrying an alternative allele was able to fertilize an individual from that population, then the allele frequencies would change due to the introduction of this new allele and the population would undergo evolution. &amp;nbsp;Migration of individuals among populations leads to&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;gene flow&lt;/strong&gt;, as individuals immigrating into the population bring new alleles, while those emigrating take alleles with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mutations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;mutation&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a change in an organism's DNA. Mutation may introduce a new allele into a population, causing small changes in the allele and genotype frequencies. Because mutations are the ultimate source of all genetic variation, &amp;nbsp;over time they can have a significant influence on the genetic structure of the population, but the mutation rate usually is very low so it is not a strong evolutionary force. In general, , most mutations found in a population &amp;nbsp;appear to be “neutral”, &amp;nbsp;having little to no effect on the phenotype. Because several different combinations of nucleotides may code for the same amino acid (recall the redundancy in the genetic code), a mutation in the DNA of a protein-coding gene may &amp;nbsp;not change the amino acid sequence of the protein. Conversely, &amp;nbsp;some mutations &amp;nbsp;can have a major effect on the phenotype. These mutations almost always result in a nonfunctional or less efficient product Very rarely, a mutation may result in a protein that is slightly more efficient, or that performs a new function. In order for the frequency of the mutant allele to increase as a result of natural selection, the advantage would have to be great enough to affect the individual's reproductive success. Therefore, although an assumption when applying the Hardy-Weinberg equation is that no net mutations occur, most mutations have little overall effect on the allele frequencies of a population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Random versus Nonrandom Mating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Random mate selection favors genetic stability. Nonrandom mate selection often occurs in natural populations because an individual is more likely to choose a mate from his or her vicinity than from more distant areas of the population. Frequent near-neighbor matings tend to subdivide the population's gene pool into subpopulations that have less genetic diversity than the entire gene pool of the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inbreeding (the mating of closely related individuals) was described earlier in this tutorial. Self-fertilization ("selfing") occurs when an individual fertilizes its own gametes (a common occurrence in plants). Both of these mating processes decrease the level of heterozygosity in the offspring. Normal healthy individuals can carry several or many deleterious alleles. Although each individual may carry some deleterious alleles, unrelated individuals are likely to be carriers of different harmful alleles. Therefore, most of the resulting offspring will be healthy carriers as well. If the parents are closely related, however, it is more likely that they are carrying the same deleterious alleles. Some of the recessive deleterious alleles will occur in the homozygous state, exposing the allele to selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, individuals may choose mates that have some of the same phenotypic traits (e.g., body size or height) as themselves. This is termed&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;assortative mating&lt;/strong&gt;. Although these kinds of characters are complex, involving numerous genes, they are still usually heritable. Mating of genetically similar (although not necessarily related) individuals tends to increase the amount of homozygosity in the population.&amp;nbsp; However, nonrandom mating does not change allele frequencies because it does not include introducing new alleles into the population, or the loss of alleles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PopulationGeneticsandEvolution-GeneticStabilityandSelectionPressure"&gt;Genetic Stability and Selection Pressure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial has focused on how &amp;nbsp;non-adaptive changes, some due to random events, can affect allele frequencies, thus affecting the genetic stability of a population. Even deleterious alleles may increase in frequency due to chance events (recall the Tristan da Cunha example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the &amp;nbsp;conditions for maintaining Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is that all individuals have the same reproductive capacity and fitness. Even minor deviations from this equality will lead to some individuals producing more offspring than others, leading to a change in allele frequencies. Any alleles that directly or indirectly affect an individual's ability to survive, mate, or reproduce may respond to selection pressure. Under strong selection pressure (e.g., when bacteria are exposed to an antibiotic), a mutation conferring some form of resistance to the antibiotic can increase in frequency in the population very quickly. In fact, antibiotic resistance is a major health concern, and both pesticide and herbicide resistance are important concerns to agriculturists. As you will learn, these examples of the evolution of resistance are a result of natural selection because the surviving, resistant individuals are better adapted to their environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, an allele that makes an individual more vulnerable to disease or predation is likely to be under very strong selection pressure and may decrease in frequency very rapidly, until it is either very rare in the population or purged completely from the gene pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Founder Effect: Test Your Understanding</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;During the early 1700’s, a small group of pacifist Protestants fled Germany to avoid religious persecution. This group, the Dunkers, settled in the farmland of eastern Pennsylvania and has been relatively isolated from other groups of people living in the area (they have strict rules about marriage outside of the group). The original group was comprised of 50 families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current Dunker population is genetically distinct from the rest of the United States (and modern Germany) in terms of the ABO blood group system. In the Dunker population, the frequency of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;allele is .30 (30%) and the frequency of the O blood type is .16 (16%). In the general US and German population the frequency of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;allele is .40 and the frequency of the O blood type is .25 (25%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the frequencies of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;alleles in both populations?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use your knowledge of the founder effect to explain the differences in ABO blood group allele frequencies between the 2 populations and indicate whether or not this is an example of adaptive evolution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Evolution and Population Size</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;From a geneticist's point of view, a population composed of hundreds or thousands of individuals is less likely to evolve than a small population. The larger the population, the more of a buffer there is against random variations in allele frequencies; an infinite size population would be almost completely resistant to random fluctuations. In contrast, small populations are especially vulnerable to the loss of genetic variability due to random events; in fact, they may evolve into extinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PopulationGeneticsandEvolution-EvolutioninSmallPopulations:GeneticDrift"&gt;Evolution in Small Populations: Genetic Drift&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small populations are much more likely to experience&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;genetic drift&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(random fluctuations of allele and genotype frequencies) than are large populations. If a population has an allele frequency of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 0.25 or 1/4, then the allele frequency of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 or 3/4. (Remember, the sum of all individual allele frequencies for a particular gene must add up to 1.) Therefore, for each&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;allele, there are 3&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;alleles in the population (or a 1:3 ratio). If a population consists of 1000 individuals and 1000 X 2 = 2000 alleles, then 500 of the alleles in the gene pool would be&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(2 X 250) and 1500 of the alleles would be&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(2 X 750). If the alleles in the next generation are counted, they may have drifted by five alleles (e.g., to 505 and 1495), but the new allele frequencies would be 0.253 and 0.748, which are very close to the original values of 0.25 and 0.75. Although there is very small &amp;nbsp;measurable change, it would take many generations before one allele became fixed in the population and the other eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if the population in the example above contained only 10 individuals (2 X 10 = 20 alleles) and the initial allele frequencies were again&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 0.25 and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 0.75, then there would be 5&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;alleles (2 X 2.5) and 15&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;alleles (2 X 7.5) in the population. If the next generation also drifted by five alleles, then there would be 10&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;alleles (5 + 5) and 10&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;q&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;alleles (15 - 5). Therefore, in one generation the allele frequencies would go from 0.25 and 0.75 to 0.5 and 0.5. If both alleles are selectively neutral (have no effect on fitness), then each faces a probability of being lost in the course of several generations, and eventually one allele will become fixed in the population. Heterozygosity at that gene would become zero and the genetic variation within the population would be reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we'll examine the two major situations that restrict population size and lead to genetic drift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PopulationGeneticsandEvolution-GeneticDriftandtheBottleneckEffect"&gt;Genetic Drift and the Bottleneck Effect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One situation that can result in genetic drift is the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;bottleneck effect&lt;/strong&gt;. A bottleneck event (e.g., earthquakes, fires, over-hunting) decimates a population and results in only a small &amp;nbsp;number of individuals surviving. In a bottleneck event, the remaining, random survivors may not have the same allele and genotype frequencies as the original population. In the new population, some alleles may be found at higher frequencies, whereas others may be found at lower frequencies or even lost altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a small but rapidly reproducing population, genetic drift will typically affect the population for a number of generations until the population size becomes &amp;nbsp;large enough that genetic drift is negligible. While natural disasters have historically been the cause of bottleneck effects, overzealous hunting can also cause this effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3452|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many endangered species, such as the cheetah (seen at right) and the American bison, provide examples of bottleneck events and reduced genetic variation. Among cheetahs, all &amp;nbsp;living individuals are genetically very similar, which &amp;nbsp;means this surviving population has less genetic variation upon which selection can act. Even when a species, such as the cheetah, is protected following a bottleneck event, the loss of genetic variability may make the species more likely to go extinct. Genetically homogeneous populations are more prone to catastrophes because a given insult (e.g., a disease or a predator) can sweep through the entire population quickly; without variation, there is nothing for natural selection to act on. &amp;nbsp;Therefore, conservation efforts must not only preserve numbers, they must also promote genetic variability. Only when some individuals are better suited to the environment than others, can evolution increase the adaptation of a population to its environment. Perhaps the potential to undergo natural selection is one of the best measures of a healthy population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is reason to think that bottleneck effects might play a major role in extinction. There is evidence that major catastrophic events (e.g., meteor strikes) might have led to major bottleneck effects in Earth's past. Such events might not have necessarily killed off all members of a species (e.g., dinosaurs), but might have decimated their population enough such that they became genetically weakened due to a loss in variability; eventually these populations died out. One book with a catchy title,&amp;nbsp;&lt;u&gt;Extinction: Bad Genes or Bad Luck?&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;by David M. Raup, explores this idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PopulationGeneticsandEvolution-GeneticDriftandtheFounderEffect"&gt;Genetic Drift and the Founder Effect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3456|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another situation that can result in genetic drift is the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;founder effect&lt;/strong&gt;. A founder event occurs when a few individuals (founding individuals) become geographically separated from the original population and &amp;nbsp;form a new population. The alleles present in the founding individuals make up the gene pool of this new population. Most likely, the founding individuals will not have the same allele and genotype frequencies of the original population, nor will they possess all of the variation present in the original population. Because it will take several generations before their population &amp;nbsp;increases much in size, genetic drift would continue to influence the allele frequencies in the population. This effect can be seen when remote islands are colonized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of the founder effect in human populations occurred on the island of Tristan da Cunha. This island was settled in the 1800's by fifteen British immigrants. There have only been a couple of migrations since; today there are just seven surnames on this island that has about 250 inhabitants. Expectedly, this leads to problems associated with&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;inbreeding&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(the mating of closely related individuals). One notable problem is the occurrence of retinitis pigmentosa (a rare form of blindness), which occurs at a much higher frequency in this population than in the original population. &amp;nbsp;Some questions in the tutorial quiz &amp;nbsp;will use this genetic disorder to illustrate how the founder effect alters the frequency of alleles in a small human population.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3454|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the cases that we have examined have had a single gene with two alleles. But what about genes that have three or more alleles? This is dealt with in the same way, but the determination of allele frequencies becomes a bit more involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You previously learned about the human ABO blood group system. This was used as an example of a gene with multiple alleles (I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;, I&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;) and codominance because both alleles are expressed in AB heterozygous individuals. The O allele (designated as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;) is recessive to the I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;and I&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;alleles. Now we’ll work a problem for a system with three alleles. In &amp;nbsp;a human population, the I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;allele has a frequency of 0.3 and the I&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;allele has a frequency of 0.1. Pull out a piece of paper and a pencil and write down these numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, calculate the frequency of the O allele. Remember, the allele frequencies for a particular gene must add up to one.&amp;nbsp; Now that you have these three allele frequencies, determine the frequencies for all of the possible genotypes in the population.&amp;nbsp; When you are finished, these should also add up to one.&amp;nbsp; If it is helpful, the H-W equation that you would use for three alleles is p+q+r=1, and the equation for the genotypes is p&lt;sup&gt;2&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;+ 2pq + q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+2pr +2qr&amp;nbsp; + r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 1.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" height="480" id="myFlashContent" width="640"&gt;&lt;object data="https://voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2107360" height="480" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640"&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/object&gt;

&lt;h2 id="PopulationGeneticsandEvolution-UsingtheHardy-WeinbergEquationinEvolutionaryStudies"&gt;Using the Hardy-Weinberg Equation in Evolutionary Studies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should now appreciate how the Hardy-Weinberg equation can be used to study the genetic composition of a population. But how does this fit into evolution studies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is that changes in allele frequencies are the most fundamental indication that evolution is occurring in a population. If two populations of the same species have the same allele frequency for a given gene, it can be concluded &amp;nbsp;that evolutionary forces are not operating on that gene (at least at that time). On the other hand, if the allele frequencies are different for a given gene, then evolutionary forces may be operating on that population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If allele frequencies remain stable between generations, then the population is considered to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Real Life Example:  Population Genetics is used to solve crimes!</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;DNA fingerprinting is used in a variety of fields including agriculture, medicine, and historical investigations. It has become particularly useful in forensics, especially in criminal investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A DNA fingerprint is created in a series of steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;DNA must be isolated - at a crime scene DNA can be isolated from blood, saliva, semen, hair or skin.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the amount of DNA that is isolated is small, PCR is used to amplify the isolated DNA (you learned about PCR in the tutorial on DNA Replication).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The amplified DNA is then cut into pieces using special enzymes known as "restriction enzymes". Restriction enzymes cut DNA at precise sequences (for example, the restriction enzyme EcoR1 cuts DNA at the sequence GAATTC)&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The DNA pieces are then run through a gel (using electricity); the smaller pieces travel further than the larger pieces. This creates a banding pattern that can be seen by fluorescing the DNA bands.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The pieces of DNA can be treated as alleles. If the frequencies of these alleles in the population are known, it is possible to calculate the probability, using the Hardy-Weinberg equation, that 2 unrelated people have the same set of alleles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DNA fingerprints below come from 3 sources – the victim of a violent crime, DNA evidence collected at the crime scene, and the primary suspect in the crime. There are 4 different gene sequences shown. For each gene, if a single band is seen that indicates the individual is homozygous for that particular gene. If two bands are seen, that indicates the individual is heterozygous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using the allele frequency information provided in the table below, calculate&amp;nbsp;the probability that the DNA from the crime scene belongs to the suspect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3450|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Probability and Populations</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;How are allele frequencies actually determined? The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Hardy-Weinberg equation&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;can be used to calculate allele frequencies. For example, let's apply the equation to PKU disease and designate the PKU allele "q," and the wild-type allele "p." What is the allele frequency for the PKU allele?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frequency of individuals who &amp;nbsp;are homozygous for the PKU allele in a population is q X q = q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. You should recognize this as the Rule of Multiplication. You should also know that q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;represents the PKU-affected individuals in the population because they are homozygous for q. The frequency of individuals who are homozygous for the wild-type alleles (the p allele) in a population is p X p = p&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The frequency of individuals who are heterozygous in a population (PKU carriers) is p X q = pq. Note, there are two ways to get this last calculation (depending on which parent donates the q allele); therefore, the Rule of Addition is also used to compute the odds of being heterozygous (pq + pq or 2pq).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a population, the frequency of PKU individuals who are homozygous for the allele + those who are heterozygous for the allele + those who are homozygous for the wild-type allele = 1. In other words, p&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ 2pq + q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 1. This is the Hardy-Weinberg equation for genotypes. (You may also recognize this as a binomial expansion.) Before going on, be sure you understand what these terms represent.Now, let's solve our original PKU problem. Restated, what is the allele frequency for the PKU allele (q)? We know that the phenotypic frequency of PKU disease is 1:10,000 or 0.0001. Remember that this is the phenotypic frequency, but we want to determine the allele frequency for the PKU allele (q). Recognize that q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the phenotypic frequency (affected individuals) in the Hardy-Weinberg equation. Therefore, the square root of the phenotypic frequency will equal the allele frequency of the PKU allele. The square root of 0.0001 is 0.01.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the wild-type allele (p) + the PKU allele (q) must equal one (p + q = 1), we can determine the wild-type allele frequency. 1.0 - 0.01 = 0.99 = wild-type allele frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3447|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's try a problem using the squirrels from Kent State, which were described earlier in this tutorial. Take out a piece of paper and work along with the following description. The key to understanding the equation is writing it out yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose that you have decided to visit Kent State for the weekend to see these squirrels for yourself. You want to determine the frequency of black (&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;) and gray (&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;) alleles in the squirrel population. Since it is not possible to see all of the squirrels on campus, you decide to count 100 squirrels and use this as your sample to determine the allele frequencies. By the end of the day you have scored 100 squirrels; 84 were black and 16 were gray. Next you need to use the Hardy-Weinberg equation to determine the frequency of these two alleles in this population. At first you decide that the allele frequencies are 0.84 for the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;allele and 0.16 for the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;allele. Is this correct? Are you overlooking something? When you see a black squirrel, what is its genotype? Black squirrels are either&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;BB&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Bb&lt;/em&gt;. So some black squirrels are carrying the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;allele. Black is a complete dominant, therefore, there is no way to tell which squirrels are heterozygous for this allele.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since you do not know if a black squirrel has a&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;BB&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Bb&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;genotype, you cannot use the number of black squirrels to determine the frequency of the black allele. But what about gray squirrels? Since gray is recessive to black, all of the gray squirrels are genotype&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;bb&lt;/em&gt;, or they represent the q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;value in the p&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ 2pq + q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;equation. Suddenly this is looking much easier. If q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 16/100 = 0.16, then q = the square root of 0.16 = 0.4. Since p + q = 1, then 1 - q = p, so 1 - 0.4 = 0.6 = p. So the frequency of the black allele (&lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;) is 0.6 and the frequency of the gray allele (&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;) is 0.4. Now that you have this information, you can estimate the frequencies of the different genotypes in the population:&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;BB&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Bb&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;bb&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Population Genetics</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;A&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;population&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a group of organisms that are members of the same species and that live in the same geographical area. While natural selection occurs at the level of the individual, through variations in fitness among individuals, evolution occurs at the population level. The reason for this is demonstrated in the following table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individual&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Population&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life Span&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;One generation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many generations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic Characterization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genotype&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allele frequencies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic Variability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;None&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considerable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evolution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;None&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can change over time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table Reference: After Table 20-1 in Strickberger, M.W. 1996. Evolution. Second Edition. Jones and Barlett, Sudbury, Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The genotype of an individual is, for the most part, determined at the moment of fertilization and cannot be changed during that individual's lifetime. However, because populations are comprised of many individuals from different generations, the allele frequencies in a population can change over time thus evolve. Population geneticists focus their studies in two areas. The first area is the measurement of genetic variation within a population. Morphological characters (e.g., variations in length, weight, coloration) and molecular characters (e.g., variations in nucleotide sequences of DNA or in amino acid sequences of proteins) are examined and quantified. The second area is the examination of the mechanisms by which genetic variation changes over space and time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evolutionary forces that can influence allele frequencies will be examined in the next tutorial. In this tutorial we will examine how allele frequencies are used to make predictions about the genotypes of a population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PopulationGeneticsandEvolution-GeneticVariation"&gt;Genetic Variation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Population geneticists measure the amount of genetic variation found within a population. Variation can be measured within a population and between populations. When there is no variation among the members of a population, the population is&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;monomorphic&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;for that particular character; monomorphic means that just one form exists. For example, the population of squirrels (&lt;em&gt;Sciurus carolinensis&lt;/em&gt;) on the Penn State campus is monomorphic for coat color; all of the squirrels in this population have gray fur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this is not true of all squirrel populations. At Kent State, the squirrel population is&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;polymorphic&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;for fur color (they have either gray or black fur).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variations in some populations for a given character can be extreme (for example, the variation of shell colors in a species of Caribbean snail).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other factors, besides genetics, can contribute to the variation of a character within a population. For example, phenotypes can be affected by the environment. When you spend a lot of time in the sun, your skin becomes darker than the color that is determined by your genotype. As you learned, the genetic disorder PKU &amp;nbsp;can be suppressed by diet. Other examples of environmental alterations are all around us. No two trees look exactly alike because branching patterns and leaf and limb numbers can be influenced by light, water, and nutrient availability. In humans, IQ and size have been linked to diet in babies and young children.&amp;nbsp; In short, the environment can influence how genetic information is expressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;div class="col s12 l4"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3444|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="PopulationGeneticsandEvolution-TheGeneticCompositionofaPopulation"&gt;The Genetic Composition of a Population&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In previous tutorials we examined the genotypes of individuals and how they relate to the phenotypes expressed in subsequent generations. Keep in mind, the genotype of an individual becomes fixed the moment that two gametes unite to form the diploid zygote (barring mutation). However, a population consists of a group of individuals that &amp;nbsp;may differ genotypically from one another. How do we describe the genotype of a population?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The genetic makeup of a population can be described by the frequency of alleles that exist in that population. This is typically expressed as a fractional equivalent of one. In other words, a population that has only one allele for a particular gene has an allele frequency of one for that allele. If two or more alleles for a particular gene exist, then each has an allele frequency that is some fraction of one (however, all of the allele frequencies must add up to one). In the example of cystic fibrosis, the major CF allele is found at a frequency of 0.04 (4%) in Caucasian populations. This means that the wild-type allele is found at a frequency of 0.96 (96%). Note that 0.96 + 0.04 = 1. Although the number of alleles may be quite variable (some genes have dozens of alleles), the simple arithmetic relationship still applies; that is, the frequencies of alleles for a given gene must add up to one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously a population can have many genes for which alternative alleles exist. In the human &amp;nbsp;species, about 30% of all genes have two or more alleles. In other words, 70% of the genes are fixed (have an allele frequency of one), whereas 30% of the genes have allele frequencies less than one.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Genetics, Selection and Speciation</title>
    <body>&lt;h3 id="Genetics,SelectionandSpeciation-IntroductionandLearningObjectives"&gt;Introduction and Learning Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of natural selection is sometimes oversimplified as "survival of the fittest". However, there are many different ways that natural selection can influence the composition of a population.&amp;nbsp; When selection acts on reproductively isolated populations it is possible for speciation to occur and form new species.&amp;nbsp; Evolutionary biologists are still debating about how to accurately define a species. As you will learn, the problem is that not all definitions work in every situation (and perhaps this statement itself provides insight into the diversity of life). We will explore a variety of species concepts.&amp;nbsp; By the end of the tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The major modes of natural selection&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why sexual selection &amp;nbsp;is a special case of natural selection, selecting for features than enhance reproductive success but may hinder individual survival&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The three major species concepts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The difference between prezygotic and postzygotic reproductive isolation, and how both keep species distinct&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The conditions that favor speciation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The distinction between allopatric and sympatric speciation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance Objectives&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summarize the role of natural selection as an adaptive evolutionary force, and describe the results of different types of selection on a population&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain stabilizing selection and why it results in a loss of genetic variation in a population.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe directional selection and how it can lead to both genotypic and phenotypic change in a population.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diagram diversifying selection and why it can lead to multiple genotypes and phenotypes in a population.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compare and contrast intra and inter-sexual selection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain how frequency dependent selection and heterozygote advantage are both types of balancing selection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compare and contrast the biological, morphological and phylogenetic species concepts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the ways that reproductive isolation can be maintained, both prezygotic and postzygotic&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe&amp;nbsp;the conditions required for allopatric speciation to occur&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain how polyploidy can lead to sympatric speciation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summarize the process of adaptive radiation and why it is often seen in organisms that live on island groups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Summary</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Natural selection is one of the most important concepts in evolutionary biology because it explains how organisms can adapt to a contemporary environment, as well as to another environment at a later time. Keep in mind that natural selection is not a goal-oriented process, in the sense that organisms "know" their evolutionary trajectory. It does not lead to a "perfect organism," but it does explain how the most well-adapted organisms in a given &amp;nbsp;environment will be more likely to have more of their alleles represented in the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural selection only works if variation exists in the population. Genetic mutation is one source of variation, however, a specific mutation does not arise on demand. Rather, variation is random, but selection is adaptive; beneficial, neutral and deleterious alleles arise spontaneously, but only the beneficial alleles will increase in frequency over successive generations through selection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does this mean that every allele is under selection? Not necessarily. Indeed, many alleles may be neither beneficial nor detrimental and so, their frequency may only change due to random events. Do not think that every alternative allele is always under selection; some may be neutral (although if conditions change, a neutral allele may become either beneficial or detrimental and subject to natural selection).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To end the course, we will consider what makes a group of organisms a species, and some current ideas about how to define species.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>A Real Life Example:  Darwin&#039;s Finches</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;During Darwin’s historic voyage, he spent time on the Galapagos Islands where he studied 13 species of finches (shown in the image below). It is known that all 13 species found on the various islands of the Galapagos are descendents of a single species of finch found on the mainland of Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3623|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 14th species of finch is found on Cocos Island. While the Galapagos is a group of islands, Cocos island is one single island and it is found approximately 400 miles from the mainland of Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use what you know about speciation to explain why 13 different types of finches evolved on the Galapagos while only one species of finch is found on Cocos Island.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3620|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darwin's finches on the Galapagos. The finches numbered 1–7 are ground finches. They seek their food on the ground or in low shrubs. Those numbered 8–13 are tree finches. They live primarily on insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Large cactus finch (&lt;em&gt;Geospiza conirostris&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;br&gt;2. Large ground finch (&lt;em&gt;Geospiza magnirostris&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;br&gt;3. Medium ground finch (&lt;em&gt;Geospiza fortis&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;br&gt;4. Cactus finch (&lt;em&gt;Geospiza scandens&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;br&gt;5. Sharp-beaked ground finch (&lt;em&gt;Geospiza difficilis&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;br&gt;6. Small ground finch (&lt;em&gt;Geospiza fuliginosa&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;br&gt;7. Woodpecker finch (&lt;em&gt;Cactospiza pallida&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;br&gt;8. Vegetarian tree finch (&lt;em&gt;Platyspiza crassirostris&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;br&gt;9. Medium tree finch (&lt;em&gt;Camarhynchus pauper&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;br&gt;10. Large tree finch (&lt;em&gt;Camarhynchus psittacula&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;br&gt;11. Small tree finch (&lt;em&gt;Camarhynchus parvulus&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;br&gt;12. Warbler finch (&lt;em&gt;Certhidia olivacea&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;br&gt;13. Mangrove finch (&lt;em&gt;Cactospiza heliobates&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Conditions that Favor Speciation</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Now that we have addressed several mechanisms that keep members of different species from interbreeding, we will focus on some theories about how new species arise (&lt;strong&gt;speciation&lt;/strong&gt;). Essentially, gene flow between closely related populations must be interrupted. This can happen in several ways; we will discuss two of them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Allopatric speciation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;occurs when populations become physically isolated due to some sort of geographical barrier.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Sympatric speciation&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;occurs when populations become genetically isolated, even though they have not been physically separated from each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allopatric speciation involves some sort of geographical isolation that physically blocks migration of individuals (and therefore gene flow) between populations. Geographical isolation may arise as a result of changes in the path of a river, the uplift of a mountain range, the formation of a canyon, or other landmass changes. A good example of allopatric speciation involves two species of antelope squirrels whose populations are separated by the Grand Canyon. Presumably they evolved from once-interbreeding populations that were isolated on either rim as the canyon was formed by the Colorado River.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sympatric speciation is speciation in the absence of geographic separation.&amp;nbsp; As you can probably predict, this occurs more rarely than allopatric speciation.&amp;nbsp; However, sympatric speciation is fairly common in plants, although it also has been documented in a few animals. &amp;nbsp;It is not unusual for errors in cell division (meiosis) to produce gametes with an extra set of chromosomes if the homologous pairs are not separated in Meiosis I. If a plant is able to self-fertilize, the union of two of these unreduced gametes results is a condition called&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;polyploidy&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp; For example, if a diploid plant produces diploid instead of haploid gametes, then undergoes self-fertilization, the offspring would be tetraploid, with four sets of chromosomes. These tetraploid individuals cannot interbreed successfully with diploid plants of the parent population, thus resulting in speciation. In this manner, speciation can occur quite rapidly (in one generation) within a sympatric population of plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Genetics,SelectionandSpeciation-AdaptiveRadiations"&gt;Adaptive Radiation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptive radiation&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;refers to the relatively rapid evolution of many new species from a single common ancestor into diverse habitats. Adaptive radiations are most often observed on island groups where new opportunities exist for immigrant species. The immigrant arrives on the island, and over time, as it moves into new habitats, the different populations become adapted to the different environments within those habitats.&amp;nbsp; Genetics diversification occurs, and eventually the populations becomes reproductively isolated from each other. Examples include the speciation of Darwin's finches in the Galapagos Islands, the diversification of honeycreepers (another group of birds) and fruit flies in the Hawaiian islands, and the radiation of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Anolis&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;lizards on different islands in the Caribbean.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reproductive Isolation: Prezygotic Isolation</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;If a species is defined as a group of potentially interbreeding populations, then it is necessary to determine what prevents certain groups of organisms from interbreeding. Is it a different anatomy, behavior, time available for mating, or some other barrier that separates populations into species? Ultimately, some form of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;reproductive isolation&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is involved. Reproductive isolation can be categorized according to whether the barrier blocks fertilization (a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;prezygotic barrier&lt;/strong&gt;) or prevents complete development after a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;hybrid&lt;/strong&gt;(an individual derived from two species) zygote has been formed (a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;postzygotic barrier&lt;/strong&gt;). This figure&amp;nbsp;summarizes how different isolation mechanisms can prevent interbreeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3609|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prezygotic barriers to reproduction include habitat, timing, behavior, and gametic isolation; any barrier that functions before a zygote is formed. In the case of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;habitat isolation&lt;/em&gt;, two species may occupy an overlapping territory but use different habitats (this is also called ecological isolation). For example, seven lizard species from a single genus live in close proximity within forested areas of the Dominican Republic. However, one of these lizards (&lt;em&gt;Anolis distichus&lt;/em&gt;) prefers sunny perches close to the ground; another (&lt;em&gt;A. cybotes&lt;/em&gt;) perches in shady, mid-level tree branches. Occupying these separate microhabitats prevents them from interacting physically, therefore, hybrids are rarely produced. Habitat isolation is also used in breeding programs; cat fanciers who raise and sell Himalayans would not want their female cats in the same room with male Abyssinian cats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3611|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two species that are receptive to mating at different times of the year, or even day, exhibit&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;temporal isolation&lt;/em&gt;. For example, the eastern spotted skunk and the western spotted skunk have overlapping ranges, but they do not produce hybrids because the western variety mates in the summer and the eastern variety mates in the winter. Similarly, there are many flower species that don't interbreed because they flower at different times of the day, season, or year, thus they cannot cross-pollinate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups of organisms that do not interbreed because they exhibit different behaviors exhibit&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;behavioral isolation&lt;/em&gt;. Eastern&amp;nbsp;and western&amp;nbsp;meadowlarks are difficult to tell apart based on size, shape, and color, however, their calls are quite distinct. Presumably this difference serves to allow the females to distinguish males from the two different species. Click on the icon beside each bird to hear its song. Can you hear a difference? Behavioral isolation may also prevent different firefly populations from mating because different species have their own pattern of light pulses. Other examples include mating dances and various courtship rituals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3613|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3615|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;mechanical isolation&lt;/em&gt;, differences in size and shape of genitalia (or flower structures) prevent successful mating.&amp;nbsp; This is commonly seen in insects, where the genitals function like a “lock and key”, so that the intromittent organ of a male will only fit into the opening of the reproductive tract of a female that is a member of the same species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gametic isolation&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is prezygotic isolation in the most literal sense. Here, gametes do not form a zygote; for any number of reasons (morphological, chemical, or environmental), the fusion of gametes does not occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What is a Species?</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Numerous concepts have been proposed to define a species, however, only three concepts will be described in this tutorial. None are perfect, but the biological species concept is the most easily applicable to sexually reproducing organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;biological species concept&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;defines a species as a group of individuals who interbreed, or have the potential to interbreed, in nature. Notice that this definition is very similar to the definition of a population. Remember that evolution works at the population level. According to the biological species concept, when individuals of a population become sufficiently different, so as to lose the capacity to interbreed, then a new species has arisen. However, this definition is not very useful for those that do not undergo sexual reproduction. It also is not useful in defining groups that are extinct, and can prove problematic in defining groups of bacteria that undergo conjugation (the exchange of small amounts of genetic information).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3607|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;morphological species concept&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(also sometimes called the typological species concept) defines a species as a group of organisms that are consistently and persistently distinct from other groups of organisms and distinguishable by their morphology (shape). &amp;nbsp;In other words, if they appear different, then they are different species. The advantage of this definition is that it works for extinct species and for those that reproduce asexually. However, it can be insufficient. For example, if you were not familiar with dogs and came upon a group of Chihuahua dogs, you might define dogs as "small, four-legged, warm-blooded animals with prominent canine teeth." If you then came upon a group of Great Danes, you could easily classify them as a second species due to their large size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;evolutionary species concept&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;groups organisms based on shared (unique) evolutionary history; the smallest group of organisms that share a common ancestor and can be distinguished form other groups that do not, essentially an evolutionary unit.&amp;nbsp; According to this definition, two species might actually be able to interbreed, yet because they have different evolutionary histories they are considered different species. Also, this species concept results in more species being recognized, because if two populations have the potential to interbreed but don’t because of their geographic location, they are considered to be different species. As you have probably realized, it can be difficult to establish at what point genetically distinct populations become their own species, and in some cases the designation of a species can be somewhat arbitrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most biologists use the biological species concept when it is practical; when not, they turn to one of the other concepts, although with the availability of genetic information for many populations, the evolutionary species concept is becoming more widely used.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sexual Selection</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sexual selection&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;describes the acquisition or selection of a mate based on a specific heritable trait; therefore, it is &amp;nbsp;special case of natural selection because the mate or a rival for mates, not the environment, is the selective agent. Specifically, sexual selection is based on secondary sexual characteristics (e.g., coloration or behavior). This type of selection usually leads to the enhancement of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;sexual dimorphism&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(differences in the secondary sex characteristics) between males and females. For example, think of the peacock and its feathers; female peahens&amp;nbsp;are more likely to mate with males bearing long, brightly colored tail feathers with a larger number of eye spots (although these feathers are not directly related to reproduction in any way). Also, the peacock's tail feathers are not a survival advantage; rather, they probably make the peacock more vulnerable to predation and they take a lot of energy to maintain. So there is a balance between sexual and natural selection.&amp;nbsp; If female preference pushes a trait further in one direction, natural selection will push back if the exaggerated trait reduces the fitness of the male because he cannot survive to reproduce.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3587|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3589|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to point out that sexual selection and natural selection are different in one important aspect. Natural selection increases the adaptation of a population to a specific set of environmental conditions, whereas sexual selection does not. However, both are forms of selection because they act to change the allele frequencies a population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other examples of secondary sexual characteristics and sexual dimorphism include the male lion's mane, the bright colors of the male cardinal and male blue jay, and the striking sexual differences in the gigantic beetles&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Macrodontia cervicornis&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Dynastes hercules&lt;/em&gt;. Note: the males of both species are over 12 inches long!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;div class="col s12 l3"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3594|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="col s12 l3"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3599|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3605|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example of sexual selection is observed in fantail darter fish (&lt;em&gt;Etheostoma flabellare&lt;/em&gt;). Females show a mating preference toward males that are already guarding eggs. This behavior is presumably a result of the increased fitness of males that are able to &amp;nbsp;protect eggs to maturity. As an effect of this behavior, some males appear with modified epidermal cells that look like fleshy knobs on their dorsal fins. These fleshy knobs mimic eggs in shape and color. Females have shown mating preference for males displaying these egg mimics, increasing their fitness.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Balancing Selection</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balancing selection&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;maintains a dynamic state of balance between advantageous and disadvantageous alleles. At first this may sound contradictory, however, think about the sickle-cell allele. You learned that individuals &amp;nbsp;who are heterozygous for the allele show an increase in fitness when living in areas of high malaria infestation. Because these individuals are more fit, the allele persists even though the individuals &amp;nbsp;who are homozygous for the allele have a marked disadvantage. At the population level, the sickle-cell allele is advantageous even though individuals with homozygous alleles are at a disadvantage. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;heterozygotic advantage&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;keeps the allele in the population through balancing selection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another example of balancing selection is&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;frequency-dependent selection&lt;/strong&gt;. This type of selection is common among traits that affect predator-prey relationships. If a trait provides the prey with an ability to avoid predation, then individuals with this trait &amp;nbsp;are less likely to be eaten and their fitness is increased. However, in many instances predators can adapt to changes in prey characteristics. If the prey allele frequency becomes high for such a trait, for example a cryptic coloration, then there is a greater chance that a predator species will eventually adapt to be able to detect that cryptic coloration, and &amp;nbsp;having the trait will no longer increase the fitness of the prey. &amp;nbsp;However, prey with a different coloration may become more fit because the predators do not see that coloration as a potential meal. &amp;nbsp;In this system, a phenotype only leads to increased fitness in the prey population if it is maintained in the population at a low level; once it becomes too common, it loses its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Types of Selection</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;An organism has specific traits that are expressed, and these can be influenced by the environment. Recall that the collective expression of traits is referred to as the phenotype of the organism. A change in a trait (e.g., flower color) results in an alternative phenotype. It follows then that any change in a population's phenotypic frequency may be a reflection of a changing environment. The peppered moths described earlier represent a good example of this phenomenon. When air quality declined, the darker moths became more common (i.e., the bark on trees became darker with soot and light moths were more visible on the bark when compared to dark moths). Now that air quality has improved, the mottled and lighter phenotype is more common.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based upon this example, you may conclude that natural selection always shows a clear increase, over time, of one trait (and a decrease of another). Indeed this does occur (as in the moth example), but different selective pressures can give rise to alternative phenotypic distributions. These situations are described by three major modes of natural selection – stabilizing, directional, and diversifying.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Genetics,SelectionandSpeciation-StabilizingSelection"&gt;Stabilizing Selection
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stabilizing selection&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;favors intermediate phenotypic variants by acting against extreme phenotypes. Organisms that display stabilizing selection may show ancestral character traits if the environment has also remained unchanged. View the animation below and click on stabilizing, then the play button to see how stabilizing selection favors an intermediate phenotype.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One condition that favors stabilizing selection is a stable environment. Many terrestrial, aquatic, and marine environments don't change much from year to year. Stabilizing selection can also occur when extremes are a disadvantage. Birth weights in humans are an excellent example. If a baby is born too small, it may not survive. Conversely, if it is born too big, it may not get out of the womb safely or it may endanger the mother (and/or itself), also reducing survival.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3585|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The horseshoe crab has many stable character traits that display stabilizing selection. Horseshoe crabs represent a group of ancient arthropods that have inhabited shallow ocean waters for a long period of time. These organisms are very well adapted to scavenging on sandy bottoms. They are a good example of stabilizing selection because when living horseshoe crabs are compared to fossils, many of their features have not changed in the past 250 million years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Genetics,SelectionandSpeciation-DirectionalSelection"&gt;Directional Selection
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Directional selection&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;favors individuals with phenotypes that are at one end of the phenotypic range; this type of selection is often seen during periods of environmental change. Directional selection favors the variants at one extreme by selecting against the other extreme; thus, resulting in a shift of the phenotype frequency curve. View the animation below, click on directional, then the play button to see how directional selection favors variants at one extreme of the phenotypic range.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, changes in weather patterns can cause directional selection. Let's say that a group of relatively tall plants exists in an area without much wind. The weather patterns change and the plants are now exposed to greater wind forces. We might expect the phenotype frequency curve to shift toward shorter plants that can withstand this change in the environment, a selective pressure. The peppered moth mentioned earlier is another example of directional selection.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Genetics,SelectionandSpeciation-DiversifyingSelection"&gt;Diversifying Selection
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diversifying selection&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(also referred to as disruptive selection) favors individuals at both extremes of the phenotypic range; this is also seen during periods of environmental change, but is less common than directional selection. Open this animation, click on diversifying, then the play button to see how diversifying selection selects variants at both extremes of a phenotypic range. Imagine a population in which the main food supply has decreased. Because less of the preferred food is available, the variants of both extremes may be able to utilize different food supplies, whereas intermediates may not be able to use either food source as well. Selection against intermediates would result, due to the decrease in available preferred food. For example, black-bellied seedcracker finches with small beaks crack soft seeds more easily than those with larger beaks. Finches with large beaks crack hard seeds more easily than those with smaller beaks. Finches with intermediate-sized beaks do not crack &amp;nbsp;either type of seed as well. Therefore, there is a shift in the population to &amp;nbsp;both &amp;nbsp;end of the distribution.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;View this animation to review the three modes of selection:&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Natural Selection</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Natural selection describes how a population, over time, adapts to &amp;nbsp;its environment. Adaptation is based on the increased fitness of individuals carrying advantageous alleles that will, over time, increase in frequency (and conversely, less advantageous alleles will decrease in frequency). For example, let's say in a certain species of bird there is an allele that produces curly wing feathers. While these curly feathers may be nice to look at, they may not lead to an increase in fitness. On the contrary, these curly-feathered birds are likely poor flyers and they may not live long enough in the wild to reproduce, so they adversely affect the bird’s fitness. As a consequence, the curly-wing allele would not persist in the population because birds having this allele don't live long enough to breed and contribute the allele to the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural selection can only act on available phenotypic variation within the population. These phenotypic variants are reflections of genotypic variation, which arises from random mutations in the genome, through crossing over during meiosis, and from sexual reproduction itself through random fertilization. Also, natural selection can only adapt organisms to the environmental conditions at that time.&amp;nbsp; If the environment changes, then the selective pressures may change and different alleles and phenotypes may be favored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are over 160 documented cases of natural selection occurring in wild populations. The peppered moth (&lt;em&gt;Biston betularia&lt;/em&gt;) story is often used to illustrate natural selection. There are two forms of the moth: one mottled (light-colored) and one black. Under natural conditions, the mottled phenotype is more common because it mimics lichen on trees, so predators (birds) can more easily see and &amp;nbsp;prey on the black moth. During the Industrial Revolution, soot from factories darkened the trees and poor air quality destroyed the lichen. This resulted in a shift of the phenotype frequency curve because the mottled phenotype became more visible to predators, and thus became the prey of choice for birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Genetics,SelectionandSpeciation-AdaptationandtheEnvironment"&gt;Adaptation and the Environment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3583|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural selection acts upon the available phenotypes in a population, adapting them to their environment by increasing or maintaining favorable genotypes, so the individuals that are better suited to current conditions in the environment survive. For example, fairy shrimp&amp;nbsp;have adapted to vernal pools (seasonal bodies of water that fill up in the spring and dry up in the summer). The shrimp complete their life cycle in as little as two weeks; hatching, breeding, and then dying. The eggs sit in the sediment until the vernal pool fills up again, and then they hatch and repeat this life cycle. In this way, fairy shrimp are well adapted to an environment that certainly would not be suitable for many other aquatic organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rarely does a single species live in a particular environment. Life is often a competition between species, and if one species gains an advantage ( through a new beneficial allele), then it often is at the expense of other individuals and species living in the same environment. This idea of a continuous race between species to be the &amp;nbsp;most well adapted for a particular environment is referred to as the "Red Queen Hypothesis" (from a line uttered by the Red Queen in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/em&gt;; i.e., "Here, you see, it takes all the running you do to keep in the same place.")&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Fitness and Selection</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Within a typical population, many characters show variation in the form of alternative traits. Some character traits vary continuously, from one extreme to another (e.g., height in a human population), and are referred to as quantitative characters. Other traits vary discretely (e.g., eye color).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these character traits may provide the individuals that have them with an advantage not &amp;nbsp;held by others in the population. If these individuals show greater differential reproductive success (i.e. they are more fit), then the allele(s) encoding the trait will increase in frequency and natural selection will have taken place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fitness&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a term that has a precise biological meaning - reproductive success. Fitness is typically referenced relatively. In simplest terms, an individual who produces four offspring is relatively more fit than one who produces three offspring (providing all offspring themselves survive to reproduce and are more fit themselves). The individual producing four fit offspring contributes 25% more of their genes to the next generation than the individual producing three fit offspring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this definition of fitness, individuals can die young and be fit, providing they produce more offspring than other members of their population. Conversely, individuals can be long-lived and unfit if they produce fewer offspring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Genetics,SelectionandSpeciation-TheSalmonExample"&gt;The Salmon Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An organism's success has little to do with its longevity, but rather, its ability to successfully reproduce. Many successful plants (e.g., annual wildflowers) grow for a season, reproduce, and then die. Many successful insects live for only twenty-four hours but still manage to reproduce and make their contribution to the gene pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, individuals contribute more to the next generation than simply their genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3580|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salmon inhabit Pacific waters and spend most of their lives in seawater, but migrate to freshwater streams to breed. The salmon that live in the Pacific Ocean and reproduce in headwater streams (small streams found at higher altitudes where few nutrients exist) have life cycles of approximately 4-5 years. The salmon that survive this perilous journey (approximately 1 in 100) reproduce and then die in the streams where they were born. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great adaptation for the next generation. By dying immediately after reproduction, adult salmon indirectly provide for their young.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does this work? Most Pacific coast headwater streams lack abundant nutrients. The nutrients released from the dead adult salmon enrich the stream and feed algal blooms and invertebrates. In turn, these organisms are a key food source for the hatchling offspring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Reproductive Isolation: Postzygotic Mechanisms</title>
    <body>In the case of postzygotic reproductive isolation, individuals from two species are capable of producing a zygote, however, these offspring (or their offspring) are incapable of normal growth and/or reproduction. Postzygotic barriers to hybridization include reduced hybrid viability, reduced hybrid fertility, and hybrid breakdown.
&lt;p&gt;In&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;reduced hybrid viability&lt;/em&gt;, hybrids between two species either fails to develop or do develop but lack vigor and rarely, if ever, reach sexual maturity. These offspring are considered unviable because ultimately, they are unable to reproduce.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;reduced hybrid fertility&lt;/em&gt;, interbreeding between species occurs and hybrids are formed, however, the hybrids themselves are usually sterile. Reduced fertility is observed in mules, which are sterile hybrids of donkeys and horses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;hybrid breakdown&lt;/em&gt;, hybrids are capable of reproducing but their offspring have either reduced fertility or reduced viability so a hybrid population cannot persist.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3609|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]

[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3616|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
If all of these isolating mechanisms do not function, there are a number of possible outcomes. If the hybrids are able to produce fertile offspring among themselves and with the parent species and the offspring have the same fitness, the two parent species may ultimately coalesce back into a single species.&amp;nbsp; The hybrids may persist in a stable hybrid zone (geographic area) between the two parent species (there are many examples of this in the scientific literature). &amp;nbsp;If the hybrids are more well adapted to the environment than either parent species, the two parent species could ultimately disappear and be replace by the hybrid (this has been documented but is very rare).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    <title>Plants I - Evolution and Diversity</title>
    <body>&lt;h3 id="PlantsI-EvolutionandDiversity,NonvascularPlants-IntroductionandLearningObjectives"&gt;Introduction and Learning Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plants are a dominant component of terrestrial ecosystems and are the source of energy for the majority of other terrestrial organisms. Modern plants descended from an ancestral plant that lived in an aquatic environment. We will study the evolutionary history of the plant kingdom to better understand the selective forces that have shaped plants' development and led to the diversity of forms in existence today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we'll examine the similarities and differences between members of the Kingdom Plantae and the red, brown, and green algae covered in the tutorial "Protists II". Of the three groups of algae, green algae are the closest living relatives to modern land plants. Adaptations for the transition from an aquatic to a terrestrial habitat distinguish members of the plant kingdom, so these features will be discussed in detail. Plants have been evolving for at least 450 million years, and based on their major adaptive features, four major plant lineages (taxonomic groups) are currently recognized. This tutorial will introduce each of these groups. You will also examine the nonvascular plants, the most primitive of the living plants lineages, Throughout the tutorials discussing plant evolution and diversity, a good strategy is to understand the major characteristics of each group, which characteristics are unique to a group, or are found across groups, and how these characteristics reflect adaptations to different environmental conditions. By the end of this tutorial you should have a working understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The origins of plants and the major factors shaping their evolution&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plant features that are adaptations to the terrestrial environment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The major plant lineages and features that are characteristic of each group&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The evolutionary relationships among the nonvascular plants, seedless vascular plants, nonflowering seed plants, and flowering seed plants&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The distinguishing characteristics of nonvascular plants and their life cycles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The three groups (mosses, liverworts, hornworts) of nonvascular plants&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance Objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify the characteristics of plants&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the benefits and challenges of living in a terrestrial environment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summarize the adaptations to terrestrial environments seen in plants&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain alternation of generations and the change in the dominant generation as plants evolved&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For each major group, identify the major characteristic(s) of that group and be able to discuss representatives that demonstrate the diversity of the group (this objective also applies to the other Plant tutorials).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify the characteristics of non-vascular plants&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the adaptations in members of this group that allow them to be successful in terrestrial environments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summarize the life cycle of a moss, a heterosporous plant, and identify the dominant stage in the life cycle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</body>

    <title>Summary</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The diversity of plants existing today is the result of 475-700 million years of evolution and adaptation to the terrestrial environment. Plants arose from a lineage of green algae and their closest protest relatives are the Charophytes. Both have cellulosic cell walls, form cell plates during cytokinesis, store carbon in the form of starch, have chlorophyll b as an accessory pigment, and share similar RNA and DNA sequences for particular genes. Charophytes are aquatic organisms, and it is highly likely that the earliest plants occupied transitional environments between the sea and the land. The transition to the terrestrial environment was advantageous for plants because there was direct access to sunlight and little to no herbivore activity. Early plants were ill-equipped for life out of the water, and desiccation was a major challenge to a land-based existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adaptations to the terrestrial environment enabled generation after generation of plants to successfully live out of the water. The waxy cuticle and stomata are effective in reducing water loss and preventing desiccation. Vascular tissue further reduces the problem of desiccation because it allows transport of water and nutrients throughout the plant. Upright growth for improved access to sunlight is also an advantage conferred by vascular tissue because it also functions in internal support of the plant body. Protection of gametes and developing embryos is the role of jacketed gametangia, and later, the seed. More recently in plant history, adaptive features have been influenced by other organisms in the terrestrial environment; some plants produce specialized flower structures and fruits that attract insects and other animals that aid in pollination and seed dispersal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nonvascular plants (including mosses, liverworts and hornworts) are highly successful and can be found the world over. They are resistant to desiccation, but prefer a moist environment due to their lack of vascular tissue and motile gametes. Nonvascular plants, like other plants, are embryophytes, and their life cycles are based on alternation of generations. The prominent generation of nonvascular plants is the multicellular haploid gametophyte. The diploid sporophyte generation is completely dependent on the gametophyte for its survival. In the more derived plant lineages, the gametophyte is greatly reduced. You should also know that the nonvascular plants do not have vascular tissue or seeds, however, they do have a stomata, a protected embryo, and most have a waxy cuticle. Seedless vascular plants are more derived than nonvascular plants and are defined by their lack of seed production and presence of vascular tissue. The more derived lineages, nonflowering seed plants and flowering seed plants, both produce seeds, but only the flowering seed plants produce flowers and fruits. Life cycles and the major characteristics of the&amp;nbsp;vascular plants will be covered in the next two&amp;nbsp;tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>A Real Life Example: Other types of photosynthesis in plants</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The Calvin cycle is also referred to as C3 metabolism because fixed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;first appears in the form of a three-carbon molecule. Carbon dioxide&amp;nbsp;and other gases enter and exit the cell through tiny pores called stomata. Plants are able to regulate the movement of gases into and out of cells by controlling the opening and closing of stomata. The opening and closing of the stomata is a balance between taking up CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;and losing water. All terrestrial plants use the Calvin cycle, but some plants initially fix carbon using alternate routes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C4 and CAM metabolism are more derived photosynthetic pathways and, in certain environments, increase the fitness of plants that utilize these pathways. In both C4 and CAM plants, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;is initially fixed into four-carbon compounds; eventually these four carbon compounds release CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;to RUBP and the Calvin-cycle enzymes act as usual.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many plants that are adapted to xeric (dry) environments, such as cacti, use a CAM pathway. In the case of CAM, carbon dioxide enters the open stomata during the night, is fixed, and the stomata are closed during the day when the Calvin-cycle operates.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does the CAM pathway better adapt plants to xeric conditions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</body>

    <title>Alternation of Generations: The Moss Life Cycle</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternation of generations&lt;/strong&gt; is an important concept in the study of plant evolution. During the life cycle of plants, generations alternate between the gametophyte (which produces gametes) and the sporophyte (which produces spores). As mentioned above, the most conspicuous (or prominent) form of all nonvascular plants is the haploid gametophyte generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand alternation of generations in nonvascular plants, study the moss (bryophyte)&amp;nbsp;life cycle in the figure below. It depicts the life cycle of a moss and helps to distinguish the haploid and diploid stages. Note the prominent form of the moss, the gametophyte, which is haploid (1n). This is the plant body that is most often observed. In the figure there are separate male and female gametophytes; however, the gametophyte can also be bisexual (male and female gametangia are located on the same plant body). In step 1, the gametophyte is the generation that produces gametes; sperm are produced in the male gametangium, the antheridium, and eggs are produced in the female gametangium, the archegonium. In step 2, the motile sperm has reached the egg, which is retained in the archegonium and fertilization takes place. (Remember, water is required for fertilization because the flagellated sperm must swim to the egg.) In step 3, the diploid (2n) zygote undergoes mitosis and begins to develop into the embryo (also 2n). In step 4, the embryo matures into the sporophyte, the diploid (2n) plant body. The sporophyte is the small, brown, stalked structure that one sometimes sees held above the main body of the moss. In step 5, meiosis takes place in the sporangium of the mature sporophyte and haploid spores are produced. In steps 6 and 7, the haploid spores are dispersed and each spore undergoes mitotic cell division to create a haploid multicellular gametophyte. The prominent haploid gametophyte is then ready to produce gametes (back to step 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important feature of the moss life cycle is that the developing embryo is retained on the gametophyte plant body. This is an adaptation to the terrestrial environment because the embryo is protected from desiccation throughout its development into the sporophyte. (Remember the description of plants as embryophytes?) If you think about haploid and diploid stages in terms of the animal life cycle, it will be difficult to make sense of the plant life cycle. As noted above, the plant life cycle includes alternation of generations, with a multicellular haploid stage. Review again, step 5 of the life cycle (where meiosis takes place). Note that meiosis does not occur again when gametes are produced. Once you recognize these differences, you should begin to feel more comfortable thinking about plant life cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Plant Phylogeny: Lineages are Defined by Major Adaptive Features</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The various adaptations to the terrestrial environment (e.g., waxy cuticles, stomata, vasculature, gametangia, seeds, and fruit) have evolved slowly during the 475 million-year history of plants. With these adaptations in mind, we will move on to a discussion of plant phylogeny and begin our review of the major characteristics of each of the plant lineages.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3641|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we begin to discuss each of the plant lineages, it is important to understand the phylogenetic relationships among them. According to this figure, are nonvascular plants "older" than nonflowering seed plants? The correct way to interpret a phylogenetic tree is to read which groups are more closely related to one another, and which groups are more primitive or more highly diverged. Living nonvascular plants are not "older" than nonflowering seed plants, but they possess a greater number of primitive character states than do nonflowering seed plants. Also, the origin of the nonflowering seed plant lineage occurred later in time than the origin of nonvascular plants, but this does not mean that currently living nonvascular plants are any older than currently living nonflowering seed plants. Flowering seed plants are the most derived lineage of plants.Now that you have a working knowledge of the major adaptations present throughout the plant kingdom and understand the evolutionary relationships among them, you will be introduced to the four lineages: (1) nonvascular plants, (2) seedless vascular plants (3) nonflowering seed plants, and (4) flowering seed plants. Always keep in mind how the adaptations found in each lineage of plants reflect the environmental conditions in which each lineage developed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PlantsI-EvolutionandDiversity,NonvascularPlants-NonvascularSeedlessPlants"&gt;Nonvascular Seedless Plants
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name of this group indicates, plants in this lineage do not have vascular tissue (or if present, it is very reduced). Because they lack substantial vasculature, plants in this lineage are generally small in size, lack significant structural support, grow close to the ground in moist areas, and lack significant water-conducting cells. Plants first evolved in environments that were transitional between the land and the sea, and although modern nonvascular plants are dependent on water to complete their life cycles, they are able to withstand long periods of desiccation. Nonvascular plants include mosses, liverworts, and hornworts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PlantsI-EvolutionandDiversity,NonvascularPlants-NonvascularPlants:EnvironmentandMorphology"&gt;Nonvascular Plants: Environment and Morphology
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the plant lineages, nonvascular plants are the most basal.&amp;nbsp; This means that these lineages diverged before that remaing groups of land plants diversified. Current information suggest that the liverworts diverged first, followed by the mosses then the hornworts. They are less derived than seedless vascular plants and seed plants, but the nonvascular plants are highly successful in the environments they inhabit. &amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image below shows a phylogenetic tree showing the hypothesized relationships among the lineages of land plants. The three groups that comprise the nonvascular plants are not members of a monophyletic groups, with hornworts more closely related to vascular plants.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3625|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3642|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you walk through a wooded area, you will likely find mosses growing on rocks, rotting wood, trees, the ground. Nonvascular plants are generally small and do not extend much more than a few inches above the surface they are growing on. Their appearance can best be described as a "carpet of green." The plant body that is most obvious is the gametophyte generation, which is haploid.Nonvascular plants typically grow in moist environments. Their lack of vascular tissue requires them to maintain close contact with water to prevent desiccation. They do not have true roots, true stems, or true leaves (which are distinguished by the presence of vascular tissue).&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Rhizoids&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;are the root-like structures that function to anchor them to the surface they are growing on, however, they are not capable of water uptake. Water is absorbed throughout the "leafy" plant body of the gametophyte. They also require a moist environment for successful fertilization. They do not produce pollen grains and have&amp;nbsp; retained the primitive condition of a flagellated sperm. The male gametes are motile in water and must be released into a moist environment so that the sperm can swim to the female gametangium (where the egg cells are located).

    <title>Adaptive Features of Plants</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;During the course of their evolution, plants have adapted to a land-based existence. Because modern plants occupy numerous, often specialized, ecological niches (e.g., deserts, rainforests, and even aquatic environments), there are many more specific adaptations than those that will be covered in this tutorial.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will focus on those adaptations that have allowed plants to overcome the challenges of a dry environment and the lack of support for upright growth. These adaptive features include: cuticles, stomata, vascular tissue, gametangia, and seeds. As each of these adaptive features is discussed, keep in mind the transition of early plants from an aquatic to a terrestrial environment and how each feature could enhance the success of plants on land.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PlantsI-EvolutionandDiversity,NonvascularPlants-WaxyCuticlesandStomata"&gt;Waxy Cuticles and Stomata
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major adaptation to the dry terrestrial environment is the waxy&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;cuticle&lt;/strong&gt;. Cuticles, composed of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;wax&lt;/strong&gt;, are found on the surface of all above-ground parts of the plant. Waxes are a class of lipids&amp;nbsp;that, due to their chemical properties, are maintained as a solid, even at the highest temperatures found in extreme conditions (e.g., deserts). Like all lipids, waxes are hydrophobic and impermeable to water. Of course, plant roots are not covered by cuticle because they are the structures responsible for water uptake and have less exposure to the air than parts of the plant that are above-ground..
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The waxy cuticle covering the surface of the plant shoot is an effective barrier to desiccation because it prevents loss of water to the air. Not surprisingly, desert plants have a much thicker cuticle layer than plants growing in wet environments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;
  &lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3634|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3635|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stomata &lt;/strong&gt;are also an important adaptive feature to the terrestrial environment. Because the cuticle is impermeable, it is necessary for plants to have pores through which gasses can be exchanged with the environment. Carbon dioxide is required for photosynthesis and oxygen is produced during this process. These gasses enter and exit the plant through the stomata. Water can also be lost through stomata, so their opening is regulated by the plant.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PlantsI-EvolutionandDiversity,NonvascularPlants-VascularTissue"&gt;Vascular Tissue
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vasculature describes a system of specialized cells found throughout the body of the plant. Vasculature has two functions. First, the specialized cells of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;vascular tissue&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;allow transport of water and nutrients throughout the plant. This adaptation enables water, absorbed by the roots of the plant, to reach the stem and leaves, and the sugars from photosynthesis, produced in the shoots, to be transported to the roots. Plants with vasculature do not have to depend on living in a moist environment to maintain adequate water throughout the plant.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second function of vasculature is structural support. Cells of the vascular tissue have secondarily reinforced cell walls that make the tissue rigid. The vascular tissue that runs throughout the plant body, circulating water and nutrients, also forms a "skeleton" that strengthens the roots, shoots, and leaves. Vascular tissue enables plants to grow upright (some to very great heights), while maintaining moisture levels in all parts of the plant.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3637|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evolution of vasculature was a major event in plant history. Plants with vascular tissue do not appear in the fossil record until approximately 425 million years ago, well after the origin of land plants. After this date there was an explosion of plant life, indicating that vascular tissue is a highly successful adaptation to life on land.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PlantsI-EvolutionandDiversity,NonvascularPlants-Gametangia"&gt;Gametangia
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3638|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition from an aquatic to a terrestrial environment was also marked by adaptations in plant reproduction. In the charophyte ancestor of modern plants, gamete production, fertilization, and development of the embryo were highly dependent on the aquatic environment. Gametes were dispersed by water currents and were maintained in a hydrated state until fertilization occurred. The zygote and growing embryo developed free from the parent organism because there was no threat of drying out. The move to land required protection from desiccation of gametes and embryos, as well as a new means of gamete and embryo dispersal.The major adaptation of plants to the terrestrial environment (with respect to reproduction) was the production of gametes and the development of embryos within&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;gametangia&lt;/strong&gt;. The gametangium (-ium, singular; -ia, plural, from Latin) can be male or female, and is the site of gamete production. The female gametangium produces egg cells and the male gametangium produces sperm. A protective chamber, formed by a single layer of sterile cells, prevents the gametes from drying out by reducing or eliminating their exposure to air. Egg cells are maintained in the female gametangium, but the sperm must leave the male gametangium and travel to the egg for fertilization to occur. Some groups of modern plants have retained the primitive characteristic of flagellated sperm and still are dependent on water for dispersal of male gametes; however, the majority of modern plants do not have motile sperm and have developed nonwater-based methods of dispersal (e.g., wind and insect pollination).In all plants, fertilization occurs within the female gametangium, where the zygote begins to develop into the embryo. Because all plants retain the developing embryo within the gametangium, they are referred to as embryophytes. Protection of the growing embryo is especially important in the terrestrial environment because the waxy cuticles, stomata, and vascular tissue present in mature plants are not well developed in the embryonic plant.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PlantsI-EvolutionandDiversity,NonvascularPlants-ProtectionoftheDevelopingMulticellularEmbryo,andSeedsandTheirDispersal"&gt;Protection of the Developing Multicellular Embryo, and Seeds and Their Dispersal
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3639|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protection of the developing multicellular embryo varies among the different plant lineages. The most primitive group of plants retains the developing embryo through sexual maturity. The diploid embryo is completely dependent on the haploid gametophyte generation. This life cycle is typical of the nonvascular plants. &amp;nbsp;The more-derived plant lineages have further adapted to the terrestrial environment by producing specialized structures for protection and nutrition of the developing embryo. The embryo is enclosed in a seed, which is dispersed from the parent plant long before the embryo reaches maturity. In the derived plant lineages, the haploid gametophyte is greatly reduced because it no longer plays a dominant role in protecting the embryo; in these groups of plants, the haploid gametophyte has become completely dependent on the diploid generation. As you will learn in tutorials discussing seed plants, seeds are a highly successful adaptation to the variable environmental conditions on land. Independent of the parent plant, the seed-enclosed embryo can withstand drying and temperature fluctuations, even the digestive tract of some animals, until conditions are suitable for germination and growth of the embryo to maturity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent adaptations to the terrestrial environment were the evolution of flowering plants and the production of fruit as a means for seed dispersal. Flowering plants produce their seeds within a fruit that provides a functional "packaging" around the seed(s). The fruit can be edible, such that the digested seeds are then deposited with the feces of the animal that consumed the fruit. Other fruits are suitable for transport on air currents, water currents, or on the fur of different animals.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first evidence of seed plants in the fossil record occurs approximately 305 million years ago. Seed production enabled plants to reproduce more successfully because the embryos had a much better chance of surviving the dry terrestrial environment than did the embryos of more primitive plants that were still dependent on the parent plant body. Just think about the advantage to plants whose offspring could be widely dispersed and were protected (within the seed) until conditions were suitable for growth. Seed plants are so dominant in the world today that we have to remind ourselves that there are numerous plants in existence that do not produce seeds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fruit production by flowering plants is a more specialized adaptation to life on land because it reflects not only the environment, but also the other life forms that exist there. Although the first flowering plants occur in the fossil record only 175 million years ago, the success of fruit production is marked by the huge radiation of flowering plants.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Transition From Aquatic to Terrestrial Environments</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Although it is not certain when plants first arose, it appears that they did so during a time when the Earth's climate was changing. Likely, those areas where plants evolved was subject to periods of flooding and periods of drying, and characteristics that enabled some species to better survive during the dry periods evolved slowly. Adaptation to the drier conditions eventually enabled early plants to colonize the land. To fully appreciate the huge advantages that terrestrial migration had for plant development, it is necessary to understand the differences between aquatic and terrestrial environments with respect to requirements for plant growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PlantsI-EvolutionandDiversity,NonvascularPlants-AdvantagesofMovingtoaTerrestrialEnvironment:IncreasedPhotosynthesisandDecreasedCompetition"&gt;Advantages of Moving to a Terrestrial Environment: Increased Photosynthesis and Decreased Competition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3631|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for plants to photosynthesize and produce the proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates necessary for growth, they require light energy. Light energy available to organisms living beneath the water's surface is greatly reduced. &amp;nbsp;The blue and especially red wavelengths of light that are absorbed by photosynthetic pigments do not penetrate deep beyond the surface of the water; therefore, photosynthetic organisms living in an aquatic environment do not receive the full amount of light energy radiated from the sun. Photosynthetic organisms growing on land do not face this problem. Photons emitted from the sun can directly strike light-absorbing surfaces and the full range of useful wavelengths are available for photosynthesis. In the aquatic environment, many large algae compete for sunlight (similar to the competition for sunlight in modern forests). For early plants first moving into terrestrial environments, there was no competition for access to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to remember the fundamental role that plants play within an ecosystem. Plants and other autotrophs are the basis for supporting heterotrophic life. Prior to colonization of the land by plants, there was little basis for support of animal or fungal life. As mentioned above, the vast majority of life existed in the ocean, including herbivores that depended on algae for food. Another great advantage to the terrestrial migration of early plants was the lack of herbivores on land. Compared to life in the ocean, the terrestrial environment provided free access to sunlight and freedom from damage by larger organisms that could crush or eat the developing plants. However, the conditions on land were not completely hospitable for early plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PlantsI-EvolutionandDiversity,NonvascularPlants-ChallengesofTerrestrialEnvironments:DesiccationandUprightGrowth"&gt;Challenges of Terrestrial Environments: Desiccation and Upright Growth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3633|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major challenge for early plants first migrating onto land was the lack of water. In an aquatic environment, desiccation is generally not a problem and there is no need for any protective covering to prevent water loss. Lacking any protection from the dry terrestrial environment, early plants probably dried out very quickly and would have been limited to very moist environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ancestors of early plants were dependent on water, not only to maintain their moisture content but also for structural support. The buoyancy of water supports upright growth of giant marine seaweeds (e.g., kelp) Consider the seaweeds that are often found washed up on the beach. Although these algae are no longer alive, when held beneath the water their upright form is restored. In a terrestrial environment, the surrounding media is air rather than water. Air does not provide any support for upright growth. The transition to land required changes in structural features, and, as will be discussed later in this tutorial, adaptations for structural support are key features used in plant classification.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Plants Share a Common Ancestor With Green Algae</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Modern land plants share some features with the group of green algae called&amp;nbsp;charophytes, and charophytes are the closest relatives of the plant kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3641|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phylogenetc tree depicts the evolutionary relationships between charophytes and plants. It is thought that the first true plants were derived from a charophyte. This means that the ancestor of all modern plants was a green algae living in an aquatic environment. There are many lines of evidence (e.g., chemical, structural, and genetic data) for the close evolutionary relationship between charophytes and plants.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Chlorophytes (green algae) have the same photosynthetic pigments found in plants. Chlorophyll a is common to other photosynthetic organisms, but chlorophyll b is shared only by green algae and plants. Characters such as a cell wall composed primarily of cellulose, storage of carbon in the form of starch, and formation of a cell plate at cytokinesis are not limited to green algae and plants; however, these shared characters provide further evidence of their relatedness. Molecular evolutionary analyses of RNA and DNA sequence data from green algae and plants also clearly place these two groups together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3627|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the similarities between charophytes and plants, plants are classified in a separate kingdom (Plantae). Charophytes are adapted to an aquatic environment, and the features that distinguish members of the plant kingdom from charophytes are their adaptations to a terrestrial environment.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PlantsI-EvolutionandDiversity,NonvascularPlants-AlternationofGenerations"&gt;Alternation of Generations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All eukaryotes that reproduce sexually have both a haploid and diploid stage in their life cycle. Although there is great variety in modes of reproduction among algae, some algaes (Brown, Red and Green) have a life cycle that includes alternation of generations; this type of life cycle is also found in plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternation of generations&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;refers specifically to a life cycle that includes the alternation between multicellular haploid life stages and multicellular diploid life stages. Diploid forms (&lt;strong&gt;sporophytes&lt;/strong&gt;) produce haploid spores, which divide and develop directly into multicellular haploid structures (&lt;strong&gt;gametophytes&lt;/strong&gt;). Gametophytes then produce haploid gametes, which join with other gametes through fertilization to form diploid sporophytes once again. The diploid and haploid generations alternate, over and over. In some organisms the diploid stage is the dominant form that is responsible for the majority of growth and resource acquisition, whereas in others the haploid stage is dominant. &amp;nbsp;We will consider the life cycle of each of the four major groups of plants, in particular the prominence of the gametophyte versus the sporophyte, and the dependence of these forms on each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3629|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PlantsI-EvolutionandDiversity,NonvascularPlants-GeologicTimeScaleforPlantEvolution"&gt;Geologic Time Scale for Plant Evolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to remember that ancestral plants had many more shared features with charophytes than those of modern plants. They would have been transitional between the green algae and the plants in existence today. The environment they occupied was most likely subject to periods of drying, such that they slowly evolved features that allowed them to exist in a terrestrial rather than aquatic environment. This theme of adaptation to environmental conditions, via natural selection, is very important in the study of plant evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fossil plant remains that clearly show features of true plants date back to at least 475 million years ago. The fossil record provides small windows into the past, and it aids scientists in approximating what life forms existed during a certain period in time. Because it can take millions of years for evolutionary changes to become established and because it is more rare than common for fossilization to occur, scientists estimate that the earliest plants began to evolve prior to the first evidence of plants in the fossil record. In fact, some molecular evidence indicates that land plants could have appeared as early as 600 million years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Summary</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;This tutorial&amp;nbsp;began our exploration of vascular plants. In particular, we examined the significance of their vascular tissue. Vasculature provides plants with a means to transport materials and aids upright growth in the terrestrial environment. Ferns were used as a representative of seedless vascular plants to examine their life cycle. We learned that the sporophyte is the dominant generation and that this diploid condition can provide plants with an advantage against the damaging effects of the sun. While the &amp;nbsp;sporophyte generation begins its life in the protection of the archegonium, the sporophyte and gametophyte live separately for part of the life cycle. During this time the gametophyte is either photosynthetic or has a symbiotic relationship with a fungus that provides its nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial also examined the evolution of the seed plants.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The seed plants show adaptations to drier environments.&amp;nbsp; First, we considered changes in the alternation of generations during land plant evolution. Then, we learned the importance of pollen and seeds in the development of land plants. We explored the diversity of extant members of the nonflowering seed plants (gymnosperms), as well as their evolutionary past.&amp;nbsp; By looking at the life cycle of a pine, we compared and contrasted the life cycles of seedless plants and nonflowering seed plants&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;p&gt;The following link is from Ohio State’s Horticulture and Crop Science in Virtual Perspective web site. This page provides information about the tree&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Ginkgo biloba&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Horticulturalists tend to use botanical terms differently than plant biologists (similarly, we often use terms differently in botany and cooking - botanically speaking a tomato is a fruit but we tend to call it a vegetable when discussing recipes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;nbsp;are two examples of horticultural terms being used differently than plant biology terms&amp;nbsp;on this page. Use what you know about the biology of ginkgos to find the examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the two&amp;nbsp;major examples?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why might horticulturalists use terms differently than plant biologists?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</body>

    <title>Nonflowering Seed Plants</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The nonflowering seed plants (the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;gymnosperms&lt;/strong&gt;) probably arose from a fern relative, appropriately named a progymnosperm, sometime between 409-363 million years ago. The nonflowering seed plants were the predominant land plants by about 225 million years ago. They were the primary vegetation available to herbivorous dinosaurs. Currently, the nonflowering seed plants are comprised of four major groups: cycads, ginkgos, gnetophytes, and conifers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonflowering seed plants are able to grow larger than seedless vascular plants because of their woody stems. The vascular tissue in most members is highly lignified, which adds strength to their cell walls. The strengthened wood allows them to achieve great heights.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The members of this group are very diverse, however, they share one distinctive feature; they all have "naked" seeds. This means that they lack&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;ovaries&lt;/strong&gt;. As you will learn, nonflowering seed plants and flowering seed plants have ovules in which their seeds develop. In flowering seed plant, these ovules are contained within an ovary; an ovary is not present in nonflowering seed plants.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PlantsII-VascularNon-floweringPlants-Cycads"&gt;Cycads
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cycads&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;are slow-growing and long-lived&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;perennials&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(they live and reproduce year after year.) They are considered woody, even though their wood does not look like that of a pine or oak tree. The leaves of cycads are large and appear feather-like, much like those of palm leaves. These leaves are arranged spirally at the top of the stem. Cycads are&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;dioecious&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;plants; that is, their male and female reproductive structures (cones) reside on separate plants. One feature retained in cycads is motile sperm. Remember, nonvascular plants and seedless vascular plants have sperm equipped with flagella for motility. However, like all nonflowering seed plants, the cycads have "naked" seeds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cycads have a special type of root called a corraloid root that develops early in the cycad’s life.&amp;nbsp; These roots are ultimately colonized by cyanobacteria (genus&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Nostoc&lt;/em&gt;). What do you think the role of these cyanobacteria is?&amp;nbsp; What type of relationship exists between the cycad and these cyanoacteria?
  &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PlantsII-VascularNon-floweringPlants-Ginkgos"&gt;Ginkgos
&lt;/h2&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3666|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;p&gt;There is only one extant (living) species of ginkgo, appropriately named&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Ginkgo biloba&lt;/em&gt;. The genus name comes from the Chinese word meaning "silver apricot" (gin=silver, kyo=apricot). The species name is Latin for "double leaf" (bi=double, loba=leaf). The leaves are uniquely fan-shaped, with a split in the middle that makes them appear to have two lobes. Like cycads,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;ginkgos&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;are dioecious and have motile sperm. Due to their broad leaves, ginkgos are often mistaken for a flowering seed plant. However, the pattern of veins (dichotomous venation) in the leaves is unlike any found in flowering seed plants. Look closely and you will see that each vein splits in two as it passes across the leaf.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common place in America to find a ginkgo tree is along the sidewalk. They are frequently used to add color and shade to urban settings.&amp;nbsp; There are many ginkgos on Penn State’s University Park Campus. The ginkgo tree is particularly resistant to disease, insects, and air pollution. In addition, the leaves turn a beautiful yellow in autumn, just before they fall. Considered to be a living fossil, Ginkgo-like fossils have been found dating back over 270 million years.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PlantsII-VascularNon-floweringPlants-Gnetophytes"&gt;Gnetophytes
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three genera of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;gnetophytes&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Weltwitschia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Ephedra&lt;/em&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Gnetum&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp; These are probably the least familiar gymnosperms.&amp;nbsp; The relationships among the groups of gymnosperms are still not known with certainty.&amp;nbsp; Some molecular studies suggest that they are a monophyletic group, while others support the hypothesis that the gnetophytes and the conifers (below) form a group that is more closely related to flowering plants.&amp;nbsp; Still other studies suggest that only the gnetophytes are more closely related to angiosperms.&amp;nbsp; The gnetophytes are the only gymnosperms to undergo a process known as&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;double fertilization&lt;/strong&gt;. In double fertilization, two sperm cells enter the ovule; one fertilizes the egg and the other fertilizes another cell within the ovary.&amp;nbsp; This process is found in all angiosperms, but could also be the result of convergent evolution.&amp;nbsp; Many groups of researchers are pursuing phylogenetic studies of the gymnosperms, so stay tuned!&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PlantsII-VascularNon-floweringPlants-Conifers"&gt;Conifers
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pine trees, firs, spruces, larches, yews, junipers, cedars, cypresses, and redwoods are all conifers. Most of these are evergreens, however, there are a few&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;deciduous&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(trees that drop their leaves each fall) conifers (e.g., the cypress trees in the Florida everglades or the larch trees in central PA). The name&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;conifer&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;comes from the Latin word meaning cone bearing. Conifers can be either&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;monoecious&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;or dioecious. That is, their male and female reproductive structures reside on the same or different plants, respectively. Unlike other nonflowering seed plants, their sperm are not flagellated; they are delivered directly via the pollen tube.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conifers date back to the Mesozoic period. Unlike the other tropical nonflowering seed plants, most conifers are found in the forested parts of the Northern Hemisphere. They are by far the most economically and ecologically important members of the gymnosperms. You probably are familiar with the 2X4's used in construction. These boards, as well as many others, are made from pine trees. The wood of pine trees is softer than that of flowering seed plant trees, therefore, it is easier to hammer nails into this wood.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PlantsII-VascularNon-floweringPlants-TheNonfloweringSeedPlantLifeCycle"&gt;The Nonflowering Seed Plant Life Cycle
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will discuss the life cycle of nonflowering seed plants, using pines as an example. The male cones produce haploid pollen grains (spores) by meiosis. The pollen grains &amp;nbsp;develop into microgametophytes (male gametophytes). The female cones have scales that each contain two ovules. Each ovule has one opening called the micropyle. When the ovule is ready to accept pollen, it secretes a liquid to which the pollen grain can adhere. As the liquid dries, the pollen is pulled into the ovule through the micropyle. At this point, a specialized cell within the ovule goes through meiosis to produce four haploid cells (megaspores). Only one &amp;nbsp;megaspore survives, growing and dividing to produce the immature megagametophyte (female gametophyte). Several eggs can develop within the megagametophyte.&amp;nbsp;
  &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3678|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the eggs are developing, two sperm cells are developing within the pollen grain. A third cell in the pollen grain begins to grow as the pollen tube moves toward the megagametophyte. Once the pollen tube reaches the megagametophyte, the sperm cells fertilize the egg cells. Note that pollination occurred when the pollen grain reached the ovule but fertilization did not occur until the sperm reached the egg. In most cases, fertilization does not happen until at least one year after pollination.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only one fertilized egg will survive and develop into an embryo. The embryo is diploid, therefore, it becomes the sporophyte of the next generation. In seedless plants the fertilization and development of the next-generation sporophyte takes place separate from the first-generation sporophyte. However, in this life cycle, the female gametophyte remained within the parental sporophytic tissue.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The embryo is made up of a rudimentary root and several embryonic leaves. The seed consists of three types of tissue: the new generation sporophyte or diploid embryo; the haploid female gametophytic tissue that stores nutrients; and the parent sporophytic tissues of the seed coat. The processes of gamete formation, pollination, fertilization, and germination are often very slow, and the life cycle can take two to three years from beginning to end.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Seed Plants: Sporophytes More Prominent, Gametophytes More Reduced</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3656|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now you should be familiar with the alternation of generations present in all plants, and that the gametophyte (1n) and the sporophyte (2n) exist in multicellular forms. The gametophyte is the dominant form in nonvascular plants; the sporophyte is smaller and is nourished by the gametophyte as it develops. In seedless vascular plants and seed plants the sporophyte is the dominant form. This change in the dominant generation is depicted in the figure at right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second change in the alternation of generations is seen in the seedless vascular plants are most commonly represented by the ferns. For example, the ferns that are observed growing in the forest and the fern fronds (leaves) that are a part of floral arrangements are sporophytes (2n). The spores that are released from the undersides of fern fronds grow into gametophytes (1n), which live independently from the sporophyte. Note, the sporophyte is much larger than the gametophyte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seed plants represent the third modification of alternation of generations. Like the ferns, the sporophyte is the prominent generation. Unlike the ferns, however, seed plants have gametophytes that are surrounded by&amp;nbsp;sporophytic tissue. This sporophytic tissue nourishes the gametophyte; therefore, the gametophyte does not live independently from the sporophyte and is even more reduced in size.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PlantsII-VascularNon-floweringPlants-DispersalMechanisms:HaploidSporesVersusDiploidSeeds"&gt;Dispersal Mechanisms: Haploid Spores Versus Diploid Seeds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to having more reduced gametophytes, seed plants use a different method to disperse their reproductive cells than do seedless vascular plants. A seedless vascular plant (e.g., a fern) releases haploid spores into the environment. If conditions are suitable, the spore grows into a mature gametophytic generation. If conditions are harsh, the spore will persist without germinating and will lie dormant until favorable conditions are present. The spore will then germinate into a gametophyte which will produce haploid gametes by mitosis.&amp;nbsp; These gametes will then fuse to produce a zygote, which must live in a moist environment as it develops into an embryo and eventually a mature plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the seed plants, the diploid zygote and the embryo that develops from it are contained within a seed. Many seeds are able to remain dormant until conditions are optimal for germination and growth. For example, some pine seeds actually require the heat of a fire to trigger germination. This is adaptive because just after a fire the seedling can grow quickly without competition from taller trees. Therefore, spores and seeds are similar because they both are resistant to harsh conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, spores and seeds differ in their structure and composition. Spores are unicellular, haploid, and contain little storage tissue. They are also very small and relatively simple. Seeds are multicellular, larger, and can contain a large amount of storage material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3658|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another major difference between the spores of seedless plants and seeds is that the haploid spores of seedless plants are released by the parent and develop independently, whereas seeds develop within the parental sporophytic tissue. Seed plants have female spores (megaspores) and male spores (microspores). The male microspore of a seed plant produces sperm within&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;pollen grains&lt;/strong&gt;, which are transported to the female megaspore. Seed plants have a haploid megaspore that is contained within a fleshy solid mass contained within an&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;ovule&lt;/strong&gt;. A&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;seed&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a fertilized mature ovule. There are also tissues in the ovule (integuments) that become the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;seed coat&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, while seedless vascular plants disperse their offspring via haploid spores, seed plants disperse their offspring via diploid seeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PlantsII-VascularNon-floweringPlants-ImportanceofPollen"&gt;Importance of Pollen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sperm from seedless plants have flagella that propel them through water to reach the egg cell. This mechanism works well for plants in moist environments, however, these plants have a difficult time reproducing in drier environments. The pollen grain is an important adaptation to dry environments. Pollen is a tough structure that contains the precursor to sperm cells. The tough outer coat of the pollen grain is able to survive very harsh conditions, therefore, it can protect the sperm cells for years. When the pollen grain finally lands on the female structure of a plant, it germinates and sperm cells travel to the egg cell through a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;pollen tube&lt;/strong&gt;. Thus, the male gamete is protected (rather than open to the environment, as in seedless plants). This adaptation allows seed plants to live in such dry and harsh conditions as deserts. Compare the figures&amp;nbsp;below to see the difference in fertilization between seedless and seeded plants.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Seedless Vascular Plants</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Seedless vascular plants have a waxy cuticle, stomata, and well-developed vascular tissue. Their vasculature allows them to grow to larger sizes than the nonvascular plants, but they still&amp;nbsp;mostly occupy moist habitats. While this lineage is better adapted to drier habitats than are the nonvascular plants, they still require moisture for reproduction. Although the developing diploid embryo is dependent on the haploid gametophyte for survival (like mosses), the diploid sporophyte is more conspicuous and is the prominent generation of seedless vascular plants. Phylogenetically, seedless vascular plants are basal to the seed plants. The seedless vascular plants include species such as ferns and horsetails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PlantsII-VascularNon-floweringPlants-Spores"&gt;Spores&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all plants,&amp;nbsp;vascular plants have a gametophytic generation and a sporophytic generation. Recall, the sporophytic generation is the diploid part of the life cycle and produces haploid spores through meiosis. Remember that the moss life cycle is characterized by two types of haploid spores, male and female. We call this condition&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;heterosporous&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;("hetero" meaning different and "sporous" referring to the spores). In this case, the sporophyte produces (via meiosis) megaspores and microspores. Haploid megaspores develop into haploid female gametophytes, which then produce eggs. Likewise, haploid microspores develop into male gametophytes, which then produce sperm. Haploid gametes then join to form sporophytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In seedless vascular plants, both the heterosporous condition described above and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;homosporous&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;condition ("homo" meaning same) result in a single type of spore that develops into bisexual gametophytes. The fern life cycle figure, which can be viewed on the next page, depicts this condition. Bisexual gametophytes can produce both male and female gametes (sperm and eggs). Note, sperm and eggs are still separate and must join during fertilization, just as in the heterosporous condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" height="480" id="myFlashContent" width="640"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;object data="https://voicethread.com/book.swf?b=2148706" height="480" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640"&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://courses.ed.science.psu.edu/biol110/entity_iframe/node/4575" target="_blank"&gt;Plants II Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PlantsII-VascularNon-floweringPlants-LifeCycle"&gt;Life Cycle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When one compares the life cycle of a moss to that of a fern (a seedless vascular plant), the most notable difference is the relative sizes of the sporophyte and gametophyte. In mosses the haploid gametophyte is the dominant generation, whereas in ferns the diploid sporophyte is the dominant generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was life like when the early plants were colonizing land? Remember, one of the advantages of moving onto land was the new abundance of light energy that plants could access. However, light can damage DNA and induce mutations. Recall, most mutations are deleterious, and haploid organisms that suffer a lethal mutation have no wild-type copy to "rescue" them from lethal mutations. For this reason, the haploid stage is more sensitive to genetic insult than is the diploid stage. Likely, the transition from a prominent haploid stage to a prominent diploid stage was adaptive for the relatively high mutation rate suffered by terrestrial plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3651|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take another look at the moss and fern life cycles. Both have flagellated sperm. This means that they are both dependent on water for fertilization. Mosses are already very small and low to the moist ground, but ferns have vascular tissue and are much taller. This could be another reason for the dominance of the sporophyte.&amp;nbsp; Also, another major difference is that the sporophyte and gametophyte live independently for part of the life cycle.&amp;nbsp; In the case of the fern, the gametophyte is photosynthetic, much smaller and lower to the ground, where moisture is more available for fertilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other similarity between mosses and ferns is that both have antheridia and archegonia. Recall from the Plants I tutorial, these structures are the specialized gametophytic tissue where gametes are produced. The archegonium is also where the egg is fertilized once the sperm from the antheridium swims through water to reach it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PlantsII-VascularNon-floweringPlants-ClassificationofSeedlessVascularPlants"&gt;Classification of Seedless Vascular Plants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seedless vascular plants can be divided into three groups:&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Club mosses&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Lycophyta), &lt;strong&gt;Horsetails&lt;/strong&gt; (Sphenophyta), and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Ferns&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Pterophyta). Lycophytes appeared during the Devonian period but split into two lineages during the Carboniferous period. One lineage became the tall extinct trees that thrived some 300 million years ago, and a good portion of the carbon they fixed was fossilized and is now burned as coal. The other lineage of lycophytes are small nonwoody plants. These extant lycophytes are usually found in either temperate forest floors or tropical areas. One species,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Lycopodium&lt;/em&gt;, can be found in the forests around Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except for one existing genus (&lt;em&gt;Equisetum&lt;/em&gt;), the group whose members are commonly called horsetails is also extinct.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Equisetum&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;occurs in damp locations and is an example of a homosporous plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third group of seedless vascular plants is probably the most familiar. These are the ferns or pterophytes. Most of us have seen ferns growing on a forest floor or as cut fronds in a flower arrangement. There are about 12,000 species of ferns in existence today, and they are found in tropical and temperate regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the vasculature of seedless vascular plants has allowed them to grow to larger sizes than nonvascular plants, they still usually occupy moist habitats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Evolution of Vascular Plants</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3647|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first fossil record of a vascular plant is from the Silurian period, about 425 million years ago. This is a drawing of a fossil of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Cooksonia&lt;/em&gt;. There are many well-preserved fossils, some of which clearly show the vasculature that had begun to form, even in this early plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the bulbous projections at the tips of some of the stems. These are thought to have been the spore-producing structures; therefore, this is considered the sporophytic generation of the plant. This is important because it shows that the transition to a more prominent sporophyte had already occurred by this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 5 cm,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Cooksonia&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;had grown much taller than the land plants that preceded it. This was due to the vascular tissue that provided the structural support necessary to grow taller on land. Seedless vascular plants went on to dominate the land through the Carboniferous period, about 300 million years ago. At that time, they grew to heights of 15 meters or more. The period is named Carboniferous because it was characterized by swamps filled with tree ferns and other seedless vascular plants that subsequently became the coal that is mined today. The seedless vascular plants now in existence are much smaller, and they are very common in the forests of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PlantsII-VascularNon-floweringPlants-VascularTissue"&gt;Vascular Tissue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3652|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vascular tissue is the characteristic that distinguishes the&amp;nbsp;vascular plants from those plants that preceded them. While protected gametes allowed plants to move onto land, it was vascular tissue that allowed plants to dominate the landscape. Vascular tissue provides a means for transport and structural support for the body of the plant. Vascular tissue consists of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;xylem&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;phloem&lt;/strong&gt;. Xylem is primarily the vasculature through which water and minerals travel from the roots up the stems to the various parts of the plant. Phloem transports the sugars made during photosynthesis down to the roots and around the plant body to provide energy. Thus, there is a net movement of water up and nutrients down. These two types of vessels differ structurally and functionally. The xylem is made of nonliving cells that tend to be more fortified for plant strength. The phloem consists of living cells that are modified to allow the flow of soluble organic nutrients. Vascular tissue gives support to plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lignin&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is embedded in plant cell walls between the cellulose matrix, and it is a very stable molecule that does not break down easily. We are able to use wood in construction because of the strength that lignin provides. Lignin plays the same role in plants.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Summary</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The life cycle of flowering seed plants is closely tied to their flower and seed structures. In all cases, plants show a pattern of alternation of generations. In addition, all flowering plants show double fertilization, which produces a diploid zygote and triploid endosperm to feed the developing plant embryo. &amp;nbsp;Pollination biology is an important part of the flowering plant life cycle.&amp;nbsp; Pollination can be accomplished by the wind, or by animals pollinators that carry pollen from one flower to another. &amp;nbsp;Plants have evolved a number of different strategies to reduce self-pollination, an extreme form of inbreeding.&amp;nbsp; Seeds protect the developing plant embryo and are found within a fruit. The fruit can help to disperse the seed away from the parent plant to reduce competition.&amp;nbsp; Plants show indeterminate growth and will grow throughout their life time, although the rate of growth will vary at different stages.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>A Real Life Example: Stinky plants and their pollinators</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amorphophallus titanium&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a large flowering plant with a strange odor. Its nickname is “the corpse plant” and it has been described as smelling like “a rotting elephant corpse”.&amp;nbsp; Its flower is 5-12 feet tall and it has been described as the most amazing flower on earth.&amp;nbsp; The bloom only lasts 2-3 days and the strong odor is only produced during the first 8 hours of blooming. Male and female flowers are separate but are found on the same plant; they bloom at separate times to avoid self-fertilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was once rumored that the large flower was pollinated by elephants; however, this is not true. When the flower is pollinated, it provides its pollinator with food. It was also rumored that this plant could eat humans – this is also not true.&amp;nbsp; In late 2005, this plant bloomed at the U.S. Botanic Garden and thousands of people went to view it. You can see a time lapse video of that bloom at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.usbg.gov/return-titan" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.usbg.gov/return-titan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using what you know about flower pollination, what is the likely pollinator of this flower?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Amorphophallus titanium&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;monoecious or dioecious?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What type of relationship exists between&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Amorphophallus titanium&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;and its pollinator?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Plant Growth</title>

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plant growth is astonishing. Not only can plants live incredibly long (e.g., bristlecone pines), but they can also become quite large in a short lifetime. The tallest tree ever measured was a 435 foot eucalyptus in Australia. The current tallest tree is a coastal redwood that is over 379 feet tall. There is a giant sequoia tree (seen above)&amp;nbsp;named General Sherman in California. It is not the tallest, nor the widest, nor the oldest plant on Earth, but it does occupy more space than any other single organism. Its volume is estimated to be 52,508 cubic feet. That is equivalent to thirty, double-occupancy dorm rooms!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plant growth differs from animal growth. Most plants follow a pattern of indeterminate growth, whereas most animals have determinate growth. Animals generally form all of their organs and then grow until they reach a certain size. Plants develop organs as they grow. They do not have a predetermined size, and they continue to grow as long as they live, although the rate of growth will change during their life time.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Seed Anatomy</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;If pollination is successful and fertilization takes place, a zygote is formed.&amp;nbsp; It will then develop into an embryo that is contained within a seed. &amp;nbsp;A seed is a complex structure. It contains diploid and triploid components. In addition, the outer layers of the seed are derived from maternal ovule tissue. Therefore, in addition to having two different ploidy states, the resulting seed is made up of parental and offspring sporophytic tissue. To examine this more closely, we will explore the development and anatomy of a seed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cell that results from the fusion of the egg and one sperm becomes the zygote. It is diploid and begins to form the basic structures of the embryo (i.e., the embryonic root and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;cotyledons&lt;/strong&gt;). The cotyledons are also called "seed leaves." Plants that belong to Class Monocotyledone contain only one cotyledon and are referred to as&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;monocotyledons&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;monocots&lt;/strong&gt;; some common examples are grass and corn. The other class of angiosperms is Dicotyledone. Plants in this class have two cotyledons and are referred to as&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;dicotyledons&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;dicots&lt;/strong&gt;; some common examples are beans and pumpkins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3693|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cell that results from the other fertilization event is 3n (triploid). It has a nucleus formed from the fusion of two nuclei from the female gametophyte, and one nucleus from the male gametophyte. The tissue that forms from the triploid cell is known as&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;endosperm&lt;/strong&gt;, which contains the nutrients needed by the developing embryo. As a dicot embryo matures, most, if not all, of the endosperm is absorbed by the embryo. However, a monocot embryo usually does not absorb all of the endosperm. When we eat corn, the majority of the nutrients we eat are endosperm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall from the nonflowering seed plant tutorial, the seed coat is formed from tissues in the ovule termed integuments. These tissues are diploid and are part of the parent plant. Thus, a seed consists of tissues that are made up entirely of the parental type (maternal sporophytic) and tissues that result from the recent fertilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PlantsIII-VascularFloweringPlants-Seeddispersal"&gt;Seed dispersal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many seeds have shapes or structures that facilitate dispersal away from their parent plant and other seeds produced by their parent.&amp;nbsp; This is important because once a seed germinates and takes root, it is unable to move, so if it takes root too close to another plant, they will compete for resources.&amp;nbsp; Many seeds are dispersed by the wind.&amp;nbsp; Wind-dispersed seeds often have wings or “parachutes” that help carry them away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;div class="col s12 l4"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3694|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="col s12 l4"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3704|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some flowering plants have seeds that rely on animals for dispersal.&amp;nbsp; In some cases, the animals eat the fruit and the seeds pass through their digestive system and are deposited away from where they were first eating.&amp;nbsp; In other cases, animals will gather seeds (nuts) and hide or store them. &amp;nbsp;While some will be eaten, others will “escape” and go on to germinate. These relationships are a type of mutualism. There are also seeds that will “hitch a ride” on an animal’s fur or a bird’s feathers, and won’t be removed until the animal grooms itself, again depositing them some distance away from where they were first picked up.&amp;nbsp; This relationship is described as a parasitism if the animal's movement is hindered by the attached seeds.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Life Cycle of Flowering Seed Plants</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Like all plants, flowering seed plants exhibit alternation of generations. We will look at some of the important features in this life cycle in the figure below. The anthers are made up of diploid (2n) cells that undergo meiosis to form haploid (1n) cells (microspores). A microspore will undergo a series of changes (including the acquisition of a tough cell wall), leading to the formation of a pollen grain, the male gametophyte that contains two nuclei.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in the female ovary each diploid ovule undergoes meiosis to produce a megaspore that is haploid. This megaspore divides by mitosis, three times, to produce eight haploid nuclei in seven cells. One of these cells is the egg, and one cell is larger than the others and contains two nuclei. Together, the seven cells constitute the embryo sac, which is the female gametophyte. This gametophyte is totally enclosed within the ovary of the parent plant.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3689|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the egg is ready to be fertilized and the pollen grain is ready for dispersal. Pollen grains need their tough outer wall to survive the process of pollination (the transfer of pollen to the female flower parts). Once the pollen grain lands on the stigma, it germinates. One nucleus begins to grow a pollen tube that extends down into the style. The other nucleus then divides by mitosis to form two haploid sperm cells. It is at this point (with two sperm cells and one pollen tube) that the male gametophyte is mature and contains three haploid cells. If successful, the pollen tube will grow into an ovule and discharge its sperm cells. There are mechanisms to prevent more than one pollen tube from entering a given ovule.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once inside the ovule, one sperm cell fuses with the egg and the other fuses with the large cell that has two nuclei. Recall, this is known as double fertilization. The diploid zygote forms from the fusion of the sperm and the egg. A triploid cell forms from the fusion of the other sperm and the central cell. This triploid cell will then divide by mitosis to produce&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;endosperm&lt;/strong&gt;, which provides nourishment for the developing embryo. &amp;nbsp;The zygote grows within the seed and eventually the seed germinates and grows into a mature, diploid, sporophytic plant.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="PlantsIII-VascularFloweringPlants-Howcanplantspreventself-fertilization?"&gt;How can plants prevent self-fertilization?
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike most animals, many species of plants are self-fertile, which means that pollen from a plant can fertilize ovules of the same plant.&amp;nbsp; While this can be very beneficial if a plant germinates in a place away from other members of the same species, so it has no other plant to exchange pollen with, the result is extreme inbreeding which can have harmful results. Dioecious plants must cross-pollinate.&amp;nbsp; However, monoecious and synecious plants have the potential to self-pollinate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3690|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some plants have physical mechanisms that prevent or reduce the chance of self-pollination. &amp;nbsp;For instance, the pollen may mature before the stigma is receptive (sunflowers), or the stigma may be receptive before the pollen matures (magnolias). &amp;nbsp;In others, the placement of the stigmas relative to the anthers makes self-pollination difficult.&amp;nbsp; For example, in this hibiscus&amp;nbsp;the stigmas are positioned above the anthers so that pollen cannot drop onto them. &amp;nbsp;What type of animal do you think pollinates this plant?&amp;nbsp; How could the pollinator help to ensure cross-pollination?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some plants are unable to self-pollinate because they are genetically self-incompatible. This system was first discovered by Dr. The-hui Kao and his research team at Penn State.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3691|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this system, if the pollen that lands on a stigma shares an allele at the S locus with the stigma, the pollen tube cannot grow to reach the ovule.&amp;nbsp; However, if the pollen has a different allele than the stigma, then the pollen tube will be able to grow and fertilization can take place.&amp;nbsp; This requires the interaction of a molecule produced in the carpal and a similar molecule produced in the pollen.&amp;nbsp; Dr. Kao’s group discovered that the two genes producing these interacting molecules are located very close together on the same chromosome.

    <title>Flowering Seed Plants</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;There are many more species of flowering seed plants&amp;nbsp;than nonflowering seed plants; more than 250,000 species of angiosperms have been described. A flower consists of four main parts: sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sepals&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;are the outermost, leaf-like parts of the flower.&amp;nbsp; They are usually green but may be pigmented the same color as the petals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Petals&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;are the next whorl of parts in from the sepals, and they are usually the structure that we think of when we talk about flowers. Petals are often brightly colored in plants that use pollinators to transfer pollen from one plant to another.&amp;nbsp; However, plants can reproduce without petals or sepals because neither is a gamete-producing structure. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;stamen&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the male structure of a flower. It is made up of a slender&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;filament&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and the pollen-producing&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;anther&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;carried on the filament. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;carpel&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the female structure. It is located in the center of the flower and consists of a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;stigma&lt;/strong&gt;, a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;style&lt;/strong&gt;, and an ovary. The term&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;pistil&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;describes the entire female reproductive structure and is composed of one or more carpels (in the figure above, the pistil is composed of one carpel). A pollen grain lands on the stigma (which often has a sticky surface), where it germinates, then the pollen tube grows through the style to an ovule, which is contained within the ovary. The ovule produces the egg cell. This is in contrast to the female cone of a nonflowering seed plant. Recall, in the nonflowering seed plant the pollen grain enters the micropyle and the pollen tube grows through the ovule tissue, but the ovule is not contained within an ovary.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PlantsIII-VascularFloweringPlants-TypesofFlowers"&gt;Types of Flowers
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All flowers have stamens and/or carpels. In addition to these basic parts, a flower may have petals and/or sepals, or these structures can be absent, or fused. &amp;nbsp;If a flower is bisexual, with both male and female reproductive parts (stamens and carpels), it is called a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;perfect flower&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(a plant that has perfect flowers can be called&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;synoecious&lt;/strong&gt;). If a flower is unisexual, having only one of these reproductive parts, either male or female, it is an&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;imperfect flower&lt;/strong&gt;. Imperfect flowers are further classified as staminate or carpellate (also pistillate), depending on the reproductive part that is present.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some plants (e.g., corn) have male flowers on one part of the plant (the tassels at the top) and female flowers on another part (the ears on the stalk). Plants such as these are called monoecious species. The word monoecious comes from the Greek words meaning "one house." When the staminate and carpellate flowers are found on separate plants, they are a dioecious species ("two houses"). Kiwi plants are an example of a dioecious species. Kiwi growers need to grow many female plants for fruit and some male plants for pollination
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PlantsIII-VascularFloweringPlants-Pollination"&gt;Pollination
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for a flowering plant to reproduce sexually, the male pollen must reach the female stigma in a process called&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;pollination&lt;/strong&gt;. Some plants pollinate via the wind; this is also the mechanism of pollination for most gymnosperms. You have seen the silk coming out of an ear of corn. These are the styles and stigmas of the female flowers. The male pollen is located at the top of the plant in the tassels, appropriately located for the wind to distribute the pollen.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some plants are pollinated by animals (e.g., bees and hummingbirds). Their flowers are specially colored and shaped to attract a specific pollinator. Bees are attracted to flowers that are white or yellow. In addition, flowers pollinated by bees tend to have sturdy petals to support the weight of a bee, and short stamens and carpels so that the pollen can transfer to and from the bee while it drinks the nectar. &amp;nbsp;Hummingbird-pollinated flowers tend to be red, and the petals usually form a long tubular-shaped corolla. The hummingbird is attracted to the red color. When the hummingbird reaches its long beak into the corolla to eat the nectar, its forehead or throat contacts the stigma and/or anther to transfer pollen.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The various relationships between flowers and their pollinators are good examples of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;coevolution&lt;/strong&gt;. That is, the character of the flower is typically uniquely suited for a particular pollinator. One striking example occurs in flowers that are pollinated by flies. One flower, found in Malaysia, gives off a putrid smell of rotting meat that flies find quite appealing. This flower is not frequented by bees, nor do flies frequent the flowers that have smells that bees (and humans) prefer.

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction and Learning Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All living organisms use energy. As you will learn, the basic principles of energy transformations are widely applicable and apply not just to living organisms, but also to other transformations (e.g., the conversion of wind energy to electrical energy by these windmills). The biological molecules that make up living organisms were discussed in the tutorial Carbon and Life. This tutorial will concentrate on how some of these biomolecules are used to provide energy to cells and will provide an overview of the basic rules that govern energy transformations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of this tutorial you should understand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What constitutes energy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The relationship between chemical bonds and energy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The first and second laws of thermodynamics&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The free energy equation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The nature of ATP, and how it can be used to perform work&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance Objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Distinguish between potential and kinetic forms of energy and their importance to organisms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe how energy is stored in chemical bonds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;State the first and second laws of thermodynamics and their importance to biological systems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summarize the free energy equation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contrast spontaneous and nonspontaneous reactions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain how ATP is used for cellular work&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discuss the importance of reaction coupling in biological organisms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Summary</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Energy and its relationship with matter were examined in this tutorial. Life exists within the context of the physical rules of the universe. Life does not violate any of these rules; rather, these rules can be used to understand the functioning of life. It is important to understand what energy really is; that which does, or can, move matter. Matter can be things as small as electrons or as large as whales. Most of this tutorial dealt with movement of matter at the chemical level, but these first principles apply to all levels of organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The breakage and formation of chemical bonds at a subatomic level deals with the movement of electrons. Therefore, it is not surprising that these processes involve energetic considerations. Generally, energy is required to break bonds, but energy is released during bond reformation. In a chemical reaction with two reactants, bonds typically must be broken before new bonds form. For example, when methane combines with oxygen, carbon dioxide and water are formed. In this reaction, more energy is released as the bonds reform than was required to break the original bonds. This energy released is available to do work. You will learn that those chemical reactions in the cell that release energy are an important component of energy transduction and are associated with catabolic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some reactions do not release energy. Rather, energy is required in order for these reactions to take place. In fact, anabolic reactions typically require energy (this is why food is required for growth). The chemicals in food are used to supply energy, which are used, in part, to build new biomolecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important to recognize the behavior of energy and matter in the universe. These two quantities are described by the laws of thermodynamics. The first law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed; rather, energy is conserved. The second law deals with matter and states that matter is becoming more disordered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two laws of thermodynamics can be related into a quantity known as free energy. The free energy equation is useful because it predicts whether a given reaction will occur spontaneously or non-spontaneously. If the change in free energy is negative, then the reaction will occur spontaneously. If the change in free energy is positive, then the reaction will be non-spontaneous. Virtually all anabolic reactions have an overall positive free energy, but nonetheless occur with the help of energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a reaction requires energy, where does it come from? It depends on the species. Chemoheterotrophic organisms obtain energy from various high-energy carbon compounds. Photoautotrophic organisms obtain their energy from the sun. Ultimately most chemoheterotrophs depend on photoautotrophs for food, so most life on the planet depends on the sun as an energy source.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>ATP and Cellular Work</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;How does the cell use energy? The short answer is to do work. A cell does three types of work: mechanical (e.g., contracting muscle cells), transport (e.g., moving substances across the cell membrane), and chemical (e.g., non-spontaneous reactions between molecules; discussed in the next section). A major source of chemical energy for this work is&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;adenosine triphosphate&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(ATP), which is illustrated in this figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3868|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3870|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATP is a 5-carbon sugar (ribose) attached to a nitrogenous base (adenine; recall our discussion of the nucleotides DNA and RNA) and a group of three phosphates. The three phosphates are the triphosphate component of adenosine triphosphate, and they are very unstable. This instability is due to the three negative charges that create an intramolecular strain in one area of the molecule. Most reactions that involve ATP depend on the hydrolysis of the third phosphate to liberate the potential energy that can be used to do work. In addition to free energy that can do work, ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate (PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;; abbreviated P&lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;or a circled P) are released during hydrolysis. The overall reaction is summarized in the figure below. The amount of energy that is made available to do work during this process is variable (depending on a number of factors, including temperature).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;How Does ATP Perform Work?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3872|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Energy is made available from the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP + Pi. This energy provides energy for endergonic reactions. The many mechanisms that different reactions use to obtain energy from ATP are remarkable. Generally they all involve tapping into high-energy electrons found associated with the terminal phosphate group. The use of an exergonic (energy-releasing) process to drive an endergonic (energy-requiring) process is called&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;energy coupling&lt;/strong&gt;. There are many ways that this can be done. Examine how energy coupling can be used to allow an energetically unfavorable (&lt;strong&gt;non-spontaneous&lt;/strong&gt;) reaction to take place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glutamine (an amino acid) synthesis&amp;nbsp;is a thermodynamically&amp;nbsp;unfavorable reaction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Glu + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;----&gt; Glu-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ΔG for this reaction is + 3.4 kcal/mol, therefore, it is a non-spontaneous reaction. However, this reaction does occur with the help of ATP. This is accomplished by coupling the removal of the terminal phosphate of ATP and the addition of ammonia to glutamic acid. In the first step, glutamic acid becomes an unstable phosphorylated intermediate when ATP is broken down. In the second step, ammonia displaces the phosphate group and glutamine is formed. This figure summarizes how ATP can be coupled to a reaction, such that an unfavorable reaction becomes exergonic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and Pi releases energy (-7.3 kcal/mol) in excess of the energy required (+3.4 kcal/mol) for the synthesis of glutamine. Therefore, the overall ΔG for the two-step process is -3.9 kcal/mol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of energy coupling procedure is extremely important, and it allows many endergonic anabolic reactions to occur in the cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="EnergyI-Thermodynamics-ACautionaryNote"&gt;A Cautionary Note&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field of thermodynamics has a novel history. It began in the 19th century when engineers were trying to understand how to make more efficient steam-driven engines. The discoveries in this area of science turned out to have an impact on other disciplines (a phenomenon frequently observed in science). The laws of thermodynamics apply to many situations that involve the interaction of matter and energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps in an effort to reach even greater levels of understanding, attempts have been made to apply the laws of thermodynamics to all situations. My kids once tried to talk me out of cleaning their room by citing the second law; it didn't work (but they did). There are even some popular books that have attempted to explain human societies using thermodynamics (e.g., all societies tend toward disorder unless energy is provided). These analogies can be attractive and can even be quite entertaining (e.g., search the internet for "Thermodynamics of Hell"). However, many of these efforts are flawed and unfounded. While reading, be watchful about how these laws can, and cannot, be reasonably applied.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Free Energy Embodies the First and Second Laws</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free energy&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(G) is the energy available (or required) to do work in a system. If a given system releases free energy, then it can do work. Conversely, if it absorbs free energy, then work can be done on it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's return to the example of marbles being held in a hand. We will define the system as the person holding the marbles and the marbles themselves. When the marbles are held, they are relatively ordered (they have low entropy) but unstable (simply opening the hand will cause a spontaneous change in the system). The potential energy of the marbles is also relatively high. When the hand is opened, however, several things happen. First, potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. Second, friction is produced and released in the form of heat as the marbles fall through the air. Third, the system becomes disordered as the marbles bounce around (entropy increases). If the person walks around and picks up the marbles, then the thermodynamic state changes again. First, the kinetic energy exerted by the person picking up the marbles is converted to gravitational potential energy as the marbles become elevated above the ground, and second, the marbles become more ordered (less entropic). Importantly, the ordered state can be restored, but energy (in the form of the person picking up the marbles) is required to order matter.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change in free energy (ΔG) is&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;endergonic&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;if energy enters the system, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;exergonic&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;if it leaves the system. Moreover, an exergonic reaction is unstable, has a negative ΔG, and is therefore a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;spontaneous reaction&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, in this example one can see why energy flow is not 100% efficient; as the marbles fall through the air there is a production of frictional heat (which, in this example, does no useful work and represents waste). All energy transfers have some inefficiencies, which is why reactions do not transduce 100% of the available energy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organisms can only live at the expense of free energy (G). The free energy changes (ΔG) associated with life's metabolic energy involve the movement of matter. This free energy comes from a series of metabolic reactions that result in work being done at the molecular level (the movement of electrons, atoms, or molecules). Recall the relationship above, between free energy and stability; a given reaction (a system) that has the potential to do a lot of work (release a lot of free energy) is inherently unstable; it typically has a low relative entropy and tends to change spontaneously to a more stable, disordered state. In fact, the concept of spontaneity actually defines whether free energy is made available to do work (or if work is required).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free energy is more than a change in entropic state because each given system has a certain amount of total energy. However, not all of this total energy is available to do work. Free energy is a function of the total energy change of a system and the entropic change.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EnergyI-Thermodynamics-TheFreeEnergyEquation"&gt;The Free Energy Equation
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reaction actually describes a change (Δ) from one state to another. The change in free energy is denoted as ΔG. If this value is negative, then free energy will leave the system, work can be done, and the reaction will occur spontaneously.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enthalpy(H) is the total energy in a system. If this value is negative, then some energy (typically heat) will leave the system. If this value is positive, then energy will enter the system (typically heat will be absorbed from outside). An exothermic reaction has a negative -ΔH and will release heat, whereas an endothermic reaction has a +ΔH and will absorb heat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entropic state of the system is denoted S. If the reaction results in an increase in entropy, then this value is positive. If the reaction decreases in entropy, then this value is negative.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free energy is also dependent on temperature. (Recall the relationship between temperature and entropy) The value "T" is given in degrees Kelvin. (To convert Centigrade to Kelvin, add 273.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between these terms is expressed by the free energy equation:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;ΔG = ΔH - T(ΔS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more negative the value of ΔG, the more free energy released by the reaction and the more work that can be done. Conversely, as ΔG becomes progressively more positive, the energy required for the reaction to proceed also increases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EnergyI-Thermodynamics-FreeEnergyandMetabolicReactions"&gt;Free Energy and Metabolic Reactions
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the energy in a system at the start of a reaction is greater than the energy at the end of the reaction, theΔG is negative and the reaction is an exergonic reaction. This means that energy is released and can be used to do work. For example, the reactions involved in breaking down glucose to retrieve energy during cellular respiration are exergonic. Cellular respiration (which will be discussed in the next tutorials) releases energy that the cell can then use to do work. We can express this reaction as:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ 6 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;----&gt; 6 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you determined, this reaction has a ?G of -686 kcal/mol. For every 180 gms of glucose (1 mole), 686 kcals become available to do work.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, endergonic reactions require an input of energy. Photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O into sugars, requires an input of energy from the sun, so it is an endergonic process overall. In other words, photosynthesis can be described as:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;6 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ----&gt; C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reaction has a ΔG of +686 kcal/mole and requires that work be done. This work is done via energy provided by the sun.&amp;nbsp;

    <title>Laws of Thermodynamics: The Second Law</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;second law of thermodynamics&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;states that all energy-affected matter in the universe is becoming random. In other words, the total&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;entropy&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(S) in the universe is increasing.&amp;nbsp; Entropy is defined as a measure of disorder. There is an important relationship between the movement of matter and the ordering of matter. All matter in the universe is tending toward disorder, however, systems can become ordered (become less entropic) with the input of energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can any order be achieved if the tendency for matter in the universe is toward ever-increasing entropy? How can complex (and highly ordered) organisms exist at all? For that matter, how can there be any ordered states in the universe? The answer is that systems can become ordered as long as they are "open" to the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3866|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of holding 10 marbles in your hand. Your hand represents a system consisting of 10 marbles. Now, turn your hand over and let gravity (a form of energy from outside the system) act on these marbles; they not only fall out of your hand (converting potential energy into kinetic energy), but they also become relatively disordered. You can reorder these marbles back into your hand, however, it requires the input of energy from outside of the system (i.e., your body as you walk around picking them up). The ordering of the marbles back into your hand is done at the expense of entropy somewhere else in the universe. Keep in mind that life (i.e., each organism) exists as a system that is open to the universe, and ultimately the energy that organisms obtain is used, in a sense, to reverse entropic change. From a thermodynamics standpoint, if you stop eating you will die because there is no input of energy from outside your body (i.e., your system) to reverse the natural tendency of matter to disorder.&amp;nbsp; This figure&amp;nbsp;is a summary of the second law of thermodynamics using a glucose molecule as a representation of a highly ordered system.&amp;nbsp; The second law of thermodynamics favors the breakdown of the glucose molecule into CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first and second laws are intimately related, and later you will learn how this relationship can be quantitatively stated. In a general sense, life channels energy thermodynamically (via a complex series of energy transformations) for the purpose of decreasing entropy (creating order). For the majority of life forms on Earth, this energy ultimately comes from the sun. Indeed, all the order you see around you is a direct result of the small fraction of total solar radiation that is absorbed by the our planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a special relationship between temperature and entropy. The entropic state of a given system is proportional to temperature. At absolute zero (in degrees Kelvin), the entropic state of any system is zero. Although absolute zero has never been achieved (-273 deg Centigrade), the relationship between temperature and entropy is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When glucose is broken down, there is an accompanying release of energy. How do organisms use this energy? Or, better yet, why do they even need energy? These not so trivial questions require an understanding of some important general laws that govern energy utilization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thermodynamics&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the physics of energy transformations that occur in a collection of matter. Formally, any collection of matter under thermodynamic scrutiny is defined as a "system." Bioenergetics is the area of thermodynamics that deals specifically with the energetic reactions that occur in an organism; energetically, an organism is a "system." There are a few laws that apply to energy (both biological and nonbiological). The laws of thermodynamics are actually quite simple, but have some far-reaching implications (not only to life, but to all interactions between energy and matter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;first law of thermodynamics&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;states that energy is neither created nor destroyed. In other words, the amount of energy in the universe is constant. This concept is straightforward but can be confusing. You might have heard someone say that plants "make energy from the sun." Plants actually convert solar energy (sunlight) into molecular potential energy, in the form of sugar. Remember, plants do not "make" energy. Photosynthesis converts light energy (a form of kinetic energy) into chemical energy. This first law could be considered "bookkeeping." It states that the energy used and released in any reaction must be balanced. Note that the energy in one molecule can be distributed into two or more other molecules.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Metabolism and Energy</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3860|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This figure depicts a small number of the metabolic pathways in a cell. Dots represent molecules, and lines represent chemical reactions. The straight line of large dots down the center is the catabolic breakdown of carbohydrates (glycolysis), and the large ring towards the bottom is the citric acid (or Krebs) cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metabolism&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;refers to all of the chemical reactions that occur in an organism. Metabolic reactions can be categorized into those that result in the formation of polymers and other large molecules (anabolic) and those that result in the breakdown of molecules (catabolic). Anabolism and catabolism were discussed in Tutorial 3. During photosynthesis, photoautotrophs (e.g., plants) convert the energy found in sunlight into chemical energy via a series of anabolic reactions that result in the production of carbohydrates, including starch. Chemoheterotrophs (e.g., humans) eat starch and break it down via a series of catabolic reactions to obtain the stored chemical energy. Before we discuss how these chemical reactions are used to move energy around the biosphere (and why), we need to define energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;refers to that which can or does move matter (i.e., the capacity for doing work).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Kinetic energy&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;refers to energy that is associated with moving matter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Potential energy&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;refers to energy that is stored. Work is the act of moving matter, whether that matter is as small as an electron or as large as a whale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3862|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of potential and kinetic energy are all around us. For example, the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River&amp;nbsp;blocks the normal flow of water and stores potential energy behind its walls. When released, the kinetic energy of the swiftly flowing water is harnessed to provide electricity for 1.3 million people a year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a connection between kinetic energy and temperature. The temperature of an object is a reflection of the kinetic energy of its atoms or molecules. Fast molecules = high kinetic energy = high temperature. Boiling water has a much higher temperature, and subsequently a higher kinetic energy than ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EnergyI-Thermodynamics-EnergyandChemicalBonds"&gt;Energy and Chemical Bonds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how metabolic reactions are used to transform energy from one form to another, one needs to appreciate some basics about the physical forces that allow two atoms to interact. Chemical bonds hold atoms together, and these bonds form as a result of electron behavior (either directly or indirectly). Electrons have mass, hence their movement requires energy. In addition, electrons contain varying amounts of potential energy. In the vast majority of metabolic reactions, it is the electrons that are the vehicle for moving energy. How does this happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with a common chemical reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) + 2 oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ----&gt; Carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) + 2 water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reaction takes place every time you turn on a gas stove. The reaction gives off energy in the form of heat and can be used to do work (e.g., boil water). In this reaction the chemical bonds associated with the four hydrogen atoms around the carbon atom must break, then associate with the electrons associated with oxygen. Note that it takes energy to break bonds; in this case, 632 kcal of energy are required for every mole of methane that reacts with two moles of oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If energy is required, how does this reaction evolve heat energy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is that bond formation produces heat. In this example, 792 kcal of energy evolve as the new bonds form in association with oxygen. The net gain is 792 - 632 = 160 kcal/mole of energy released by the reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before ending this topic, let's clarify some case-sensitive nomenclature. In everyday usage, energy is often written in Calories (Cal, note the uppercase "C"), otherwise known as Nutritional Calories. 1 Calorie = 1,000 calories, or 1 kcal = 1 Calorie.&amp;nbsp; A calorie (with a lowercase "c") is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1° Celsius.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Energy II - Cellular Respiration (Glycolysis) and Fermentation</title>
    <body>&lt;h3 id="EnergyII-CellularRespiration(Glycolysis)-IntroductionandLearningObjectives"&gt;Introduction and Learning Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first tutorial on energy concluded with a discussion of ATP, the molecule that supplies most of the energy for cellular work. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the end product of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;cellular respiration&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a catabolic pathway comprised of a series of steps that convert the chemical energy in glucose into the energy contained in ATP. This tutorial will focus on the breakdown of glucose, but keep in mind that molecules can enter the pathway at various points; therefore, glucose is just one of several sugars that can be broken down during cellular respiration. The available energy in glucose (and other sugars) resides within its electrons. These electrons (along with their energy) are removed and passed to intermediate electron carriers in a step-by-step process. These intermediates (e.g., NADH) and the concept of reduction-oxidation reactions (electron transference) will be addressed in this tutorial. By the end of this tutorial you should understand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The general form of a redox reaction&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Redox and energy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The role of NAD+ in conveying electrons&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Glycolysis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alcohol and lactic acid fermentation, and their exploitation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance Objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Illustrate the importance of redox reactions in cellular respiration&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discuss the role of electron carriers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the process of glycolysis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify the fate of the products of glycolysis if oxygen is absent and if oxygen is present&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</body>

    <title>Fermentation</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Glycolysis generates ATP without using oxygen as an electron acceptor. Therefore, glycolysis can occur whether oxygen is present or not and whether conditions are aerobic or anaerobic. Pyruvate has two general fates: it can be further oxidized (in which case, more energy is obtained) or it can be further reduced (and discarded as waste).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process by which glucose is partially broken down and NAD+ is regenerated is&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;fermentation&lt;/strong&gt;. The many types of fermentation differ in the waste products that are formed when pyruvate is broken down. Fermentation can occur in the presence or absence of oxygen. Many bacteria only carry out fermentation in the absence of oxygen, whereas yeast will ferment in the presence or absence of oxygen. Two common types of fermentation are&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;alcohol fermentation&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;lactic acid fermentation&lt;/strong&gt;. In alcohol fermentation, pyruvate gives off carbon dioxide and is converted to ethyl alcohol (ethanol) in a two-step process. In lactic acid fermentation, pyruvate is converted to lactate (lactic acid). This figure&amp;nbsp;shows both types of fermentation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3882|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans capitalize on both of these fermentation processes. Yeast undergo alcohol fermentation in the production of beer and wine. Certain bacteria and fungi undergo lactic acid fermentation, and are used to make cheese and yogurt. There are many facultative anaerobes that can switch between fermentation and complete cellular respiration, depending on their environment.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Real Life Example:&amp;nbsp; Microorganisms and Fermentation - not just for making beer!
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The method for making naturally brewed soy sauce has been in use for over 500 years. It takes place in two stages and there are different types of microorganisms involved in the process.
  &lt;br&gt;The first stage is aerobic and involves mixing steamed soy beans and toasted crushed wheat with two species of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;fungi. The fungi break down the polysaccharides (and other macromolecules) into glucose and other monomers. This is the koji stage of production.
  &lt;br&gt;The second, or moroni, stage is anaerobic. In this stage, salt, water and yeast are added to the koji to form a mash. This mash is then put into airtight containers where it ferments for at least 6 months. During fermentation the mix is kept warm to increase the growth of microorganisms. The mash is then squeezed to get the liquid soy sauce.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is the koji stage anabolic or catabolic? During fungal digestion, glucose is formed. Is this a condensation or hydrolysis reaction?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In some countries, the import and production of naturally brewed soy sauce is regulated because it has an alcohol content of 2-10%. Be able to explain how this is possible (in your explanation, include the starting substrate(s) and end-product(s) of the metabolic pathway).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Glycolysis: The First Step in Cellular Respiration</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3878|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glycolysis&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;involves the initial breakdown of glucose to&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;pyruvate&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(or pyruvic acid), water, and reduced electron carriers (in this case NADH). The foods you eat are first broken down by your saliva, and then by enzymes in your stomach. Glucose, from your food, is then taken into your cells, and during glycolysis is split into two 3-carbon molecules of pyruvate. Glucose is not the only sugar used by your body; other sugars are either converted to glucose or introduced at other points in the glycolytic pathway. Likewise, fats and proteins can be used as energy sources. These foods are catabolized and the metabolic breakdown products enter the cellular respiratory pathway at various points. We will discuss the metabolism of glucose because it makes use of all the metabolic steps, and hence illustrates the complete process of cellular respiration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glycolysis is initiated by the addition of a phosphate (P), from ATP, to a molecule of glucose; this destabilizes the glucose molecule and the bonds are then easily broken to release energy. So while there is a net gain of ATP in cellular respiration, some ATP is used to start the process.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glycolysis is a ten-step process, but all of the specific intermediate molecules and enzymes involved won't be discussed here. However, you should understand the general way in which ATP is produced during glycolysis. At two steps, a phosphorylated molecule (e.g., the substrate PEP) transfers a phosphate group to ADP. This&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;substrate-level phosphorylation&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;can only occur in the presence of a specific &lt;strong&gt;kinase&lt;/strong&gt; enzyme (which differs according to the particular substrate that is donating the phosphate).&amp;nbsp; Protein kinases are&amp;nbsp;enzymes that catalyze&amp;nbsp;the transfer of a high-energy phosphate groups one molecule&amp;nbsp;to another.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes two molecules of ATP to break down one molecule of glucose to pyruvate. The output is four ATPs and two NADHs. Therefore, there is a net gain of two ATPs and two NADHs from one molecule of glucose from glycolysis alone. Most of the energy remains in the pyruvate molecule.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3880|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This figure&amp;nbsp;shows the overall energy "balance sheet" for glycolysis. Note the initial "investment" of energy in the early stages, which requires 2 ATP molecules per molecule of glucose. In the later stages, 4 ATP molecules and 2 NADH molecules are produced, which yields a net production of 2 molecules of pyruvate, 2 molecules of ATP, and 2 molecules of NADH per molecule of glucose.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EnergyII-CellularRespiration(Glycolysis)-Pyruvate(continued)"&gt;Pyruvate (continued)
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the products of the initial breakdown of glucose is pyruvate. Pyruvate is further modified and enters the next stages of cellular respiration (the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain). It is at these stages that most of the ATP is produced for cellular work. Probably because of its connection to the production of chemical energy, pyruvate has become a very popular nutritional supplement among dieters and body builders. The merits of pyruvate are greatly disputed. For general interest, you may want to do a web search for "Pyruvate" for interesting comparisons of popular claims to actual research.

    <title>The Stages of Cellular Respiration</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Respiration can be broken down into three metabolic stages:
  &lt;br&gt;1. Glycolysis
  &lt;br&gt;2. The Krebs, or Citric Acid cycle
  &lt;br&gt;3. Electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most eukaryotic cells, glycolysis (stage 1) occurs in the cytosol (the protein-rich, semi-fluid part of the cell in which the cell's organelles are immersed), whereas the Krebs cycle, electron transport, and oxidative phosphorylation (stages 2 and 3) occur in the mitochondria. While our discussion will focus on cellular respiration in the eukaryotic cell, you should note that this process also takes place in prokaryotes (even though they lack mitochondria).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes glycolysis is presented as a process separate from cellular respiration, so don't be confused if you hear someone mention "glycolysis and cellular respiration."

    <title>Redox and Cellular Respiration</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3874|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxygen is highly electronegative; it tends to pull electrons toward itself and away from other molecules. Consequently it takes energy to keep electrons away from oxygen. As the electrons move closer to oxygen, they lose energy and the energy that is released can be used to do work. Cellular respiration is actually a series of reactions in which electrons are sequentially moved from glucose (and its catabolic products) to oxygen, or in some cases, to an alternative terminal electron acceptor. In the process, energy is released. In other words, cellular respiration is a series of redox reactions in which energy is gradually made available to do work. The work done is the synthesis (anabolism) of ATP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general equation for cellular respiration is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ 6 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;--&gt; 6 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + energy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of this as a redox process. In this case, glucose is oxidized and oxygen is reduced. Remember, oxygen is highly electronegative (electrons are drawn to it). Ultimately, oxygen is reduced to form water and glucose is oxidized to produce carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this redox reaction is written as one equation, it really happens in a series of steps. The reason for this should be evident from the previous two questions. That is, a high amount of energy is released from the oxidation of glucose and unless the body controls this oxidation, much of the energy is wasted as heat. Therefore the cell gradually oxidizes glucose in a series of controlled steps, and electrons (and accompanying energy) are gradually released. Restated, in the oxidation of glucose energy is gradually liberated and becomes available to synthesize ATP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EnergyII-CellularRespiration(Glycolysis)-NAD+andElectronTransport"&gt;NAD+ and Electron Transport&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3876|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general equation for cellular respiration is quite simple, however, the overall process actually takes place in several stages in different parts of the cell. For example, hydrogen atoms (and accompanying electrons) are not directly transferred from glucose to oxygen. There are several intermediate steps, with intermediate oxidants (electron carriers). The most prevalent electron carrier is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. This electron carrier can exist in its reduced form (NADH) or as an oxidized positive ion (NAD+). NAD+ is free to pick up electrons, whereas NADH has two more electrons and an additional proton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A molecule of NAD+ or NADH consists of two nucleotides (adenine, found in RNA and DNA, and nicotinamide) joined together. In the presence of the enzyme dehydrogenase and hydrogen, NAD+ can become reduced to NADH. The structure of the oxidized form is shown on the left side of the figure, and the right side shows that portion of the molecule where reduction occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NAD+ functions as an oxidizing agent (electron acceptor) during cellular respiration, picking up electrons from the catabolic products of glucose (along with hydrogen atoms). Each NAD+ molecule can be reduced with two high-energy electrons and one hydrogen atom. Importantly, once the transfer is complete and the reduced NADH has deposited its electrons, the regenerated NAD+ can pick up more electrons and begin again. In other words, NAD+ acts as an energy shuttle. Think of this process in the following way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;XH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ NAD+ --&gt; X + NADH + H+&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, "X" is any molecule that gives up an electron and two hydrogens. Note that there is a single proton, H+, which remains unpaired after this transaction. These protons (hydrogen ions) accumulate and are very useful in certain stages of respiration (to be discussed later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="EnergyII-CellularRespiration(Glycolysis)-WhatDoWeKnowSoFar?"&gt;What Do We Know So Far?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You now have the background information to learn the steps of cellular respiration. You should know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High-energy molecules are unstable and can spontaneously change into low-energy molecules, accompanied by a release of energy that can do work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Glucose is a highly ordered, high-energy molecule that is broken down (catabolized) in the transduction of cellular energy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cellular respiration takes place in a series of steps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ATP has three high-energy-containing phosphate groups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The general equation for cellular respiration (the oxidation of glucose)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How ATP drives cellular work&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The three types of cellular work&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What "redox" means&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How NAD+ functions as an electron carrier&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

    <title>Redox Reactions</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The term&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;"redox"&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is short for the chemical process known as "reduction-oxidation." It refers to the transfer of electrons that occurs during many chemical reactions. Electron transfer is important to the life of a cell. During cellular respiration, there is a relocation of electrons. This relocation results in the release of energy that is stored in food molecules, and the released energy is used to synthesize ATP. Remember the first law of thermodynamics which describes the conversion of energy; you can't "make" energy but energy can be transferred from one molecule to another. Redox is one way that this is accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During many cellular reactions, energy changes are due to the movement of electrons (molecules either gain or lose electrons). A molecule that gains an electron is reduced, meaning that there has been a "reduction" in its positive charge. This gain in electrons is termed&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;reduction&lt;/strong&gt;. A molecule that loses an electron is oxidized, and this loss of electrons is termed&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;oxidation&lt;/strong&gt;. You can remember this somewhat confusing terminology with the mnemonic "OiL RiG", where (O)xidized species (L)ose electrons and (R)educed species (G)ain electrons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general equation of a redox reaction is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Xe- + Y --&gt; X + Ye-&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this equation, molecule "X" is oxidized and loses an electron (and energy), whereas molecule "Y" is reduced and gains an electron (and energy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some molecules have a very high affinity for electrons, therefore, they are more likely to oxidize other molecules. The affinity for electrons is termed&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;electronegativity&lt;/strong&gt;. The more electronegative a molecule is, the more likely it will become reduced by the addition of electrons in a chemical reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, not only do electrons move from one molecule to another during a redox reaction, so does energy. In other words, a molecule that is oxidized loses energy, whereas a molecule that is reduced gains energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EnergyII-CellularRespiration(Glycolysis)-RedoxandCombustion"&gt;Redox and Combustion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;; also known as natural gas) combustion releases energy, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;, and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O as final products. This occurs in the presence of oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; which is highly electronegative) every time one ignites a gas stove in a house supplied with natural gas. (This example was also used in the tutorial Carbon and Life)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This figure illustrates the conversion of methane gas into CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and energy. Note that while electrons are transferred from methane to oxygen, energy is released that can do work (the reaction is exergonic). In the process of redox, methane is converted into carbon dioxide (which contains an oxidized form of carbon) and water (which contains a reduced form of oxygen). The electrons that are associated with oxygen in the water molecule have much less energy than they had when associated with carbon in methane; this energy difference is released as heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While heat is useful for cooking, it is not very useful for biological reactions. During redox reactions that occur within your body, a high proportion of the energy that is released is moved into other forms of chemical energy. However, heat is released as a by-product of these reactions because no reaction is 100% efficient.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Energy III - Cellular Respiration (Krebs Cycle and Electron Transport Chain) </title>
    <body>&lt;h3 id="EnergyIII-CellularRespiration(KrebsCycleandElectronTransportChain)-IntroductionandLearningObjectives"&gt;Introduction and Learning Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The previous tutorial concentrated on the first stage of cellular respiration - glycolysis. You should know that glycolysis produces 2 molecules of pyruvate, 2 molecules of ATP, and 2 molecules of NADH. The pyruvate can be used in fermentation, but it can also be further metabolized in the presence of oxygen. There are many high-energy electrons left in pyruvate and thus it contains energy that can be utilized by the respiring cell. In this tutorial you will learn how cells complete cellular respiration by oxidizing pyruvate to carbon dioxide. You will also learn that these electrons are conveyed to an electron transport chain where they can participate in the synthesis of ATP. By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Krebs cycle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The electron transport chain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chemiosmosis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The energy balance of cellular respiration&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance Objectives:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Illustrate the importance of redox reactions in cellular respiration&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discuss the role of electron carriers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;List the Krebs Cycle inputs and outputs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diagram the structure of the mitochondrial inner membrane&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Illustrate the flow of electrons through the ETC&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate how the hydrogen ion gradient across the inner membrane is produced&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain how ATP is produced through oxidative phosphorylation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe how other molecules can enter the pathways of cellular respiration at different points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Summary</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;This tutorial focused on the final steps of cellular respiration; the Krebs cycle and the Electron Transport Chain and chemiosmosis. &amp;nbsp;Recall that at the end of glycolysis there is a net production of two molecules of ATP and two molecules of NADH. The ATP is produced via substrate-level phosphorylation; in this reaction, a phosphate group on an organic molecule is transferred directly (along with high-energy electrons) onto a molecule of ADP. Substrate-level phosphorylation also occurs once during the Krebs cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those organisms that completely oxidize glucose, the end product of glycolysis (pyruvate) is further oxidized by enzymes associated with the Krebs cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle and the tricarboxylic acid cycle or TCA cycle). In eukaryotes, the enzymes associated with the Krebs cycle are found in the mitochondria. Pyruvate moves into the mitochondria via specific carrier proteins located in the mitochondrial membranes (in prokaryotes, the Krebs cycle enzymes typically are not compartmentalized but are located in the same compartment as the glycolytic enzymes). Pyruvate is converted to acetyl CoA (accompanied by the evolution of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;and one molecule of NADH). The acetyl CoA then enters the Krebs cycle. Within the cell, the Krebs cycle organic acids are not arranged in a circle nor is there any circular arrangement of the enzymes. This pathway is termed a "cycle" (and diagrammed as a circle) because the end product becomes the first product after reacting with acetyl CoA. Acetyl CoA is not the only way that reduced carbon can enter the Krebs cycle. For example, the degradation products of some amino acids enter the Krebs cycle as organic acids (e.g., phenylalanine is converted to fumarate).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For every molecule of acetyl CoA that enters the cycle, there is a net gain of three molecules of NADH, one molecule of FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;(a chemical relative of NADH), and one molecule of ATP (the ATP is produced via substrate-level phosphorylation). Two molecules of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;are produced as a by-product. As with glycolysis, there is only a marginal gain of ATP; the majority of energy is tied up in the NADH and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;molecules. How is this energy liberated? To answer this we need to consider the work that is done by NADH and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high-energy carriers NADH and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;can themselves be oxidized by the electron transport chain. During oxidation, energy is lost by the oxidized molecule while energy is gained by the reduced molecule. The electron transport chain is composed of a series of molecules that alternatively become oxidized and reduced by one another. As these redox reactions occur, free energy is made available to do work, and that work is the movement of charged hydrogen atoms (protons) across a membrane. The electron transport chain is mostly contained within the membrane, and energetically, the electrons that pass from one molecule to the next have decreasing potential energies. The last molecule that is reduced is oxygen, which results in the generation of water. Some bacteria can use other molecules (e.g., nitrate, sulfate, or organic acids) as terminal electron acceptors, and hence can undergo cellular respiration under anaerobic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how is ATP produced? During the movement of electrons down the electron transport chain, protons accumulate on the other side of the inner mitochondrial membrane; mitochondria have a double membrane. The accumulation of charged ions, separated by a nonconductive membrane, creates a voltage. In other words, the mitochondrion can be thought of as a battery that is charged by the electron transport chain. Also existing within the inner membrane is a complex known as the ATP synthase complex. This complex acts as a channel in which protons flow back into the mitochondrion. As these protons move back into the mitochondria, free energy is released as the charge differential decreases; the resulting energy is used to synthesize ATP. In other words, the electron transport chain charges the battery, and the ATP synthase discharges it and uses the energy to produce ATP.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>A Real Life Example: The Energy (calories) Contained in Beer</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;During fermentation, many microorganisms produce ethanol. The beverage industry exploits this process in the production of beers, wines, and distilled spirits. When humans consume ethanol it is metabolized in the liver.&amp;nbsp; This metabolism of ethanol occurs in three main steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first step of metabolizing ethanol, alcohol dehydrogenase converts ethanol to acetylaldehyde and a molecule of NADH is produced.&amp;nbsp; In the second step, acetylaldehyde oxidase converts acetylaldehyde to acetate and another molecule of NADH is produced.&amp;nbsp; In the third step, acetyl-CoA synthase produces acetyl CoA from acetate and Coenzyme A. Acetyl CoA then enters the Krebs cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assuming that the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain are working efficiently, how many TOTAL molecules of NADH and FADH2 are produced in the catabolism of one molecule of ethanol?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assuming NADH and FADH2 are converted to ATP at 40% of maximum efficiency in our bodies, how many molecules of ATP are produced from the breakdown of one molecule of ethanol?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</body>

    <title>Oxidative Phosphorylation and ATP Yield</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Substrate-level phosphorylation occurs during glycolysis and the Krebs cycle and yields a relatively small amount of ATP. The generation of ATP from chemiosmosis at the end of the Electron Transport Chain is referred to as&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;oxidative phosphorylation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;because oxygen's oxidative property allows a large amount of free energy to be made available for the synthesis of ATP. &amp;nbsp;This process generates a relatively large amount of ATP for the cell when compared to substrate-level phosphorylation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3892|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This figure emphasizes several important concepts about cellular respiration. First, note the locations of glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation. Second, note how the electron carriers transport electrons to the transport chain, and the net amount of ATP generated at each step. In particular, compare the amount of ATP generated by oxidative phosphorylation to the amount generated by substrate-level phosphorylation. The maximum net yield of 38 ATPs per molecule of glucose is merely an estimate. Much of the energy bound in a molecule of glucose is actually lost as heat during metabolism. While this heat is actually a waste product, homeotherms ("warm-blooded" animals) capitalize on this "waste" and use it to maintain constant body temperatures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Electron Transport Chain</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;NADH and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;convey their electrons to the electron transport chain. This transport chain is composed of a number of molecules (mostly proteins) that are located in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. Each membrane protein has a particular electronegativity (affinity for electrons). The more electronegative the molecule, the more energy required to keep the electron away from it. In this way, a slightly electronegative membrane protein will pull electrons away from reduced electron carriers. In the presence of an even-more electronegative molecule, these electrons will be oxidized from the first membrane protein, and so on. Finally the electrons reduce oxygen, and along with the addition of hydrogen ions, water is produced as a waste product. This stepwise movement, whereby an electron from one protein is transferred to another in the chain, is also reflective of the overall decrease in the amount of energy that the electron possesses. Importantly, each step has a -ΔG. Therefore with each oxidation/reduction reaction, energy is made available to do work. This work involves the movement of protons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3888|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxygen is one of the most electronegative atoms. This is important because the relative change in electronegativity determines how much energy is available to do work. When oxygen acts as the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;terminal electron acceptor&lt;/strong&gt;, there is a maximal amount of free energy released; hence, more protons can be transported, which means that a greater charge buildup occurs across the inner mitochondria membrane. This figure illustrates the energetic relationship between various members of the electron transport chain when oxygen serves as the electron acceptor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EnergyIII-CellularRespiration(KrebsCycleandElectronTransportChain)-Chemiosmosis"&gt;Chemiosmosis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the movement of electrons through the electron transport chain, protons accumulate on the inside of the inner mitochondrial membrane. As electrons move from one member of the electron transport chain to the next, protons are transported from one side of the membrane to the other, resulting in a buildup of protons in the intermembrane space. This creates a charge differential (voltage) across the inner membrane; it is this stored energy that is actually used to synthesize ATP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As these excess protons from the intermembrane space flow back into the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;mitochondrial matrix&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(the part of the mitochondrion enclosed within the inner membrane, which houses the enzymes and substrates for the Krebs cycle), ADP is phosphorylated to make ATP (&lt;strong&gt;chemiosmosis&lt;/strong&gt;). Chemiosmosis is accomplished in the presence of the protein complex&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;ATP synthase&lt;/strong&gt;, which is also located in the inner mitochondrial membrane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3890|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note how the transfer of electrons provides the energy to move protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This buildup of protons in the intermembrane space creates a charge differential (voltage), and this stored energy is then used to drive the ATP synthase complex to affect the production of ATP.&amp;nbsp; This figure&amp;nbsp;shows an overview of the Electron Transport Chain and oxidative phosphorylation.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>The Krebs Cycle</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3884|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you learned in the previous tutorial, glycolysis results in a net gain of 2 ATP and 2 NADH molecules from one molecule of glucose. Keep in mind, this gain represents an effective transfer of 20 kcal of energy to ATP (about 10 kcal each) and about 80 kcal of energy to NADH (about 40 kcal each), for a total of about 100 kcal. The complete oxidation of glucose results in the release of 684 kcal of energy, therefore, there is significant energy still remaining in pyruvate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In eukaryotes, pyruvate is transported across the mitochondrial membrane and then converted to acetyl CoA (with the production of NADH and carbon dioxide). Acetyl CoA is then oxidized by a series of enzymes that make up a cyclical series of reactions known as the Krebs cycle (some textbooks refer to this as the citric acid cycle). During the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Krebs cycle&lt;/strong&gt;, electrons are removed from acetyl CoA and these electrons reduce more NAD+, along with another electron carrier,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;FAD&lt;/strong&gt;. The ATP that is produced is generated via substrate-level phosphorylation, just as it was in glycolysis. Each NADH and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;molecule that is formed is an important source of energy that will be used to generate ATP.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you will not be required to memorize all of the intermediates (e.g., isocitrate, fumarate, etc.) and enzymes involved in the Krebs cycle, this figure demonstrates the overall reactions that result in the complete oxidation of acetyl CoA. You can also see where carbon dioxide is released as a by-product and where electron carriers are reduced to form NADH and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Also note that the ATP formed results from the direct transfer of a phosphate from a substrate (substrate-level phosphorylation).&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3886|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This figure&amp;nbsp;is a summary of the Krebs cycle, illustrating the main reactants (acetyl CoA, NAD+, FAD, ADP, and inorganic phosphate) and products (carbon dioxide, NADH, FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and ATP) from what is actually a multistep process.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="EnergyIII-CellularRespiration(KrebsCycleandElectronTransportChain)-TheRoleofNADHandFADH2"&gt;The Role of NADH and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glucose catabolism ends during the Krebs cycle. This does not mean that all of the energy previously contained in glucose was used in the production of ATP. In fact, only one additional ATP molecule (per molecule of pyruvate) is produced by substrate-level phosphorylation in the Krebs cycle. The balance of extracted energy is tied up in NADH and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next phase of cellular respiration, the high-energy electrons within NADH and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;will be passed to a set of membrane-bound enzymes in the mitochondrion, collectively referred to as the &lt;strong&gt;Electron Transport Chain &lt;/strong&gt;(ETC). These electrons will provide energy to do work. Specifically, this work will involve the movement of positively charged hydrogen atoms (H+), also known as&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;protons&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movement of protons across the inner mitrochondrial membrane (by the electron transport chain) creates a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;charge differential (voltage)&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;that will be used to synthesize ATP.&amp;nbsp;

    <title>Energy IV - Photosynthesis (Light-dependent Reactions)</title>
    <body>&lt;h3 id="EnergyIV-Photosynthesis(Light-dependentReactions)-IntroductionandLearningObjectives"&gt;Introduction and Learning Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of life on Earth could not exist without&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;photosynthesis&lt;/strong&gt;. Recall from the tutorial on Thermodynamics&amp;nbsp;that during photosynthesis light energy is converted to chemical energy. Specifically, it is the process whereby plants, protists, and some bacteria use light, water, and carbon dioxide to make sugars. Photosynthesis is not the exact opposite of cellular respiration, but rather a separate process that just so happens to contain many similar features (e.g., an electron transport chain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Photosynthesis can be divided into two parts: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (also referred to as the "dark" reactions). This tutorial will cover the light-dependenet reactions. These reactions transform light energy into chemical energy that can be used by cells. The next tutorial will cover the light-independent reactions which synthesize sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;By the end of this tutorial you should have an understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plants' requirements for photosynthesis and respiration&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The light reactions of photosynthesis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Characteristics of light&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Channeling of light energy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Electron transport chains and the Z-scheme&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Generation of ATP.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance Objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Illustrate the importance of redox reactions in photosynthesis &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discuss the role of pigment molecules in photosynthesis &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify the role of Photosystems I and II in the light dependent reactions &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Illustrate the flow of electrons through the ETCs and Photosystems &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate how the hydrogen ion gradient across the thylakoid membrane is produced &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain how ATP is produced through photophosphorylation &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review the relationship between the light-dependent and light-independent reactions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</body>

    <title>Think Like a Scientist:  Does variegation of leaves affect growth rate?</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epipremnum aureum&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(common name Pothos) is a common tropical houseplant that originates from&amp;nbsp;the Solomon Islands. The leaves of this plant can be solid green (as in the golden pothos in the&amp;nbsp;picture on the right) or variegated as in Pothos ‘Marble Queen’ shown on the left (leaf variegation refers to the white patches on the leaves). Your roommate&amp;nbsp;is a plant biology major and wishes to study the effect of variegation on growth rates and chilling&amp;nbsp;sensitivity in pothos. She collects the data in Table 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Help her with the following items:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What effect does variegation seem to have on growth rate (as indicated by the mean number&amp;nbsp;of leaves and vines)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Present a plausible hypothesis for why plants with variegated leaves show this difference in&amp;nbsp;growth rate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

    <title>The Electron Transport Chain: Redox</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Free energy is released during the redox reactions of the electron transport chains. This energy is used in two ways.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the electron transport chain that follows photosytem II, the movement of electrons through the chain releases energy that is used to move protons across the thylakoid membrane just as in the electron transport chain of cellular respiration in the mitochondria. &amp;nbsp;The protons are moved into the thylakoid space where they accumulate and produces a voltage across the membrane. &amp;nbsp;Also associated with this electron transport chain is the enzyme ATP synthase. &amp;nbsp;The ATP synthase uses the voltage formed by the build-up of protons in the thylakoid space to produce ATP. &amp;nbsp;Functionally, the electron transport chain that follows photosystem II is similar to the electron transport chain of respiration; the accumulation of protons on one side of a membrane provides the free energy that ATP synthase needs to drive the production of ATP.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the electron transport chain that follows photosystem I, the electrons that move through the chain are used to reduce&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;NADP+ &lt;/strong&gt;to&lt;strong&gt; NADPH&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two products of the light-dependent reactions of photosystem are ATP and NADPH. &amp;nbsp;The movement of high energy electrons releases the free energy that is needed to produce these molecules. &amp;nbsp;The ATP and NADPH are used in the light-independent reactions to make sugar.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where do the electrons come from? Water molecules are split at the beginning of the first electron transport chain. The splitting of water provides electrons that become energized in the photosystems, and protons that accumulate across the membrane.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As water is split and electrons and protons are removed, oxygen is released. Thus, oxygen is a by-product of photosynthesis. &amp;nbsp;Recall from the tutorial Prokaryotes III&amp;nbsp;the oxygen that is released as a by-product of photosynthesis had a major impact on the early earth's atmosphere and is the source of the oxygen that we breathe.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light energy raises electrons associated with pigment molecules to a higher energy state and these electrons are used to reduce NADP+ to NADPH, and to supply energy for the accumulation of protons into the thylakoid space.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charge separation across the thylakoid membrane represents stored energy in the form of a voltage (similar to what happens within mitochondria during cellular respiration). This figure&amp;nbsp;compares ATP synthesis in the two organelles. As shown, chloroplasts also make use of the voltage via ATP synthase proteins in the membrane. These are similar to the ATP synthase molecules associated with cellular respiration. In a process called&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;photophosphorylation&lt;/strong&gt;, they harness the energy from protons moving across the membrane to make ATP from ADP and phosphate. &amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the ATP produced by the electron transport chain following photosystem II and the NADPH produced by the electron transport chain following photosystem I will be used by the light-independent reactions to build a sugar. How a plant uses this ATP and NADPH to build a sugar will be covered in the next tutorial.&amp;nbsp;

    <title>The Electron Transport Chains: The Z-Scheme</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;As you learned in the tutorial on cellular respiration, an electron transport chain&amp;nbsp;is a series of redox reactions. There are two electron transport chains used in photosynthesis and they are energetically linked to one another as electrons travel through both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3902|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This figure&amp;nbsp;illustrates the movement of electrons through the two electron transport chains. &amp;nbsp;Both photosystems are absorbing sunlight at the same time but let's start our analysis by looking at the activity in photosystem II. &amp;nbsp;Light is absorbed by photosynthetic pigments and the absorbed energy excites an electron to a higher energy state. &amp;nbsp;The excited electron moves around the photosystem until it is transferred to the primary electron acceptor molecule of the associated electron transport chain. &amp;nbsp;The electron travels through the electron transport chain (via a series of redox reactions) until it is passed to a chlorophyll molecule in&amp;nbsp;photosystem I. &amp;nbsp;Sunlight is absorbed by the pigment molecules in photosystem I and the electron is once again excited and transferred along the electron transport chain associated with photosystem I. When this process is diagrammed, it looks like the letter Z on its side. An electron is excited to a higher energy state, falls back down in energy, is excited again, and falls back down again. Thus, the two electron transport chains are called the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Z-scheme&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water is the source of the electrons that are used in photosynthesis. As shown in this figure, electrons are removed from water in photosystem II, and consequently, these electrons become energized into a more energetic state. Protons and oxygen are released as by-products of this reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, the electron transport chain of respiration occurs in the mitochondria, while the electron transport chains of photosynthesis are located in the chloroplasts. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Light Energy is Channeled by Photosystems</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3898|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leaves of deciduous trees are usually green in the summer and then turn colors and fall off in autumn. These bright fall colors come from red and orange pigments such as carotenoids. These pigments exist in the leaf all summer, but it is not until the pigment chlorophyll is depleted that the other colors become obvious.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In eukaryotes the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis occur in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;thylakoids&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;chloroplasts&lt;/strong&gt;. Chloroplasts are flattened disc shaped organelles that contain stacks of thylakoids called&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;grana&lt;/strong&gt;. Thylakoids contain the essential components (e.g., pigments and electron transport chains) of the light reactions of photosynthesis. The thylakoid is covered with several types of pigments arranged into&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;photosystems&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This figure shows the structure of a photosystem. &amp;nbsp;In most land plants, there are two types of photosystems -&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;photosystem I&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;photosystem II&lt;/strong&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Structurally, these photosystems are similar and the following description of the photosynthetic activity in a photosystem can be applied to either photosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3900|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The various pigments in a photosystem (e.g., different forms of chlorophyll and carotenoids) each absorb sunlight of a different wavelength. &amp;nbsp;The absorbed energy raises electrons associated with the pigment molecule to a higher energy state. &amp;nbsp;This causes the electrons to become unstable and the unstable electrons are passed to a specialized chlorophyll molecule at the center of the photosystem (the reaction center). From this reaction center, the electrons will be passed to an electron transport chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does this movement of electrons occur? &amp;nbsp;Recall from earlier tutorials, electrons are found in association with atoms, where they can participate in bond formation. Electrons have varying amounts of energy. In a non-illuminated pigment (one in the dark), critical electrons are usually found in a low energy state. However, the energy from an incoming photon of light can bump the electron into a higher energy state. &amp;nbsp;When this happens, light energy has been absorbed and energy has been transformed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Wave-Like Character of Light</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Photosynthesis requires sunlight. But what is sunlight? To answer this question, we will answer three questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Where does sunlight come from?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does sunlight travel from place to place?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What happens when sunlight reaches an object?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to the first question is that sunlight comes from thermonuclear reactions in the sun, which release energy in the form of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;electromagnetic radiation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to the second question is that sunlight (and other forms of light) has both wave and particle characteristics and it travels from place to place as both a wave and as discrete particles of energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let's look at the wave properties. Light is similar to x-rays, microwaves, and radio waves because they all have a periodic fluctuating character (a wave) that travels through space. They differ because of their&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;wavelengths&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(the peak-to-peak distance between oscillations). Importantly, electromagnetic waves can transfer energy to objects in their paths. Visible light&amp;nbsp;is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that has wavelengths detectable by the human eye. These are wavelengths of about 400-700nm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3894|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EnergyIV-Photosynthesis(Light-dependentReactions)-TheParticle-LikeCharacterofLight"&gt;The Particle-Like Character of Light&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3896|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If light acts as a wave that travels through space, how can it also act as a particle? &amp;nbsp;Light travels as "packets," or quanta of energy known as photons. Each photon has a specific amount of energy. &amp;nbsp;Photons can "bump" into things in their path. These disturbances cause some of the effects of light in the world around us.&lt;br&gt;This brings us to the third question posed about light. What happens when light reaches another object? We have all seen light reflect off of a mirror, which allows us to see ourselves. We have also avoided wearing a black shirt (instead of a white shirt) in the summer because of the heat it absorbs. These two properties of reflection and absorption can help us to understand how plants use light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because light consists of photons of energy, reflection can be thought of as photons bouncing off of a leaf. However sometimes the photons of light are absorbed by the leaf to do work. &lt;strong&gt;Pigments&lt;/strong&gt; are compounds that absorb light. Different pigments absorb different wavelengths of light. If a structure (e.g., a leaf) lacks pigments that absorb light in a given wavelength range, then that wavelength of light will be reflected. In other words, the color perceived is that which is not absorbed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown in this figure, many colors are absorbed by chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments. Importantly, note that green light is absorbed poorly, which is why chlorophyll-containing leaves appear green to our eyes; green light is not absorbed by green plants, it is reflected.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Photosynthesis&#039; Light Reactions: An Overview</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Scientists are always looking for alternative energy sources. Everyone has heard of solar-powered cars, and we tend to think of them as a new technology. Plants, however, have always been solar powered. In fact, humans (and other heterotrophs) are dependent on the ability of plants to transform light energy into chemical energy via the process of photosynthesis. Humans transform stored chemical energy into mechanical energy and heat. Solar-powered cars rely on the sun's energy being transformed into electrical energy (&lt;strong&gt;photochemistry&lt;/strong&gt;). In each of these cases energy is being transformed but never created or destroyed. This should be familiar as the first law of thermodynamics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;Metabolism refers to all of the chemical processes in a cell. It is usually divided into two categories: catabolism and anabolism. Cellular respiration is an example of catabolism, whereas photosynthesis is an anabolic process.&amp;nbsp;
  &lt;br&gt;While most people think of plants when photosynthesis is mentioned algae are responsible for more photosynthesis than plants. It has been estimated that about 90% of the oxygen produced from photosynthesis comes from algae and phytoplankton living in oceans. Plants, protists, and even some bacteria undergo photosynthesis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EnergyIV-Photosynthesis(Light-dependentReactions)-PlantsUndergoPhotosynthesisandCellularRespiration"&gt;Plants Undergo Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cellular respiration&lt;/strong&gt;: sugar + oxygen --&gt; carbon dioxide + water + energy to do cellular work&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;photosynthesis&lt;/strong&gt;: light energy + carbon dioxide + water --&gt; oxygen + sugar&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many plants have cells, tissues, and organs that do not photosynthesize. For example, most roots have no photosynthetic capacity. Typically sugars are produced in the photosynthetic tissues and transported to other areas of the plant for immediate nutrition and storage. As already discussed, cellular respiration is required for cells to convert the chemical energy in sugars into ATP. Therefore plants must also undergo cellular respiration in all cells in order to function properly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, plants have mitochondria and chloroplasts. Therefore they are able to carry out photosynthesis and cellular respiration.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Energy V - The Light-Independent Reactions of Photosynthesis (Calvin Cycle) </title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3908|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last tutorial explored the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. These reactions begin with the absorption of light energy by pigments, and end with the production of stored chemical energy in the form of NADPH and ATP. Now we will follow the NADPH and ATP molecules as they enter the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Calvin cycle&lt;/strong&gt;. Their stored energy will be used to make sugar from carbon dioxide. These anabolic reactions are endergonic (+ΔG), and therefore require energy (from ATP and NADPH). The basic relationship between the Calvin cycle and the light-dependent reactions is summarized in the figure below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These reactions are sometimes called the "dark reactions" because they can occur in the dark (as long as ATP and NADPH are available). All of the processes of photosynthesis (both light-dependent and light-independent reactions) occur within the chloroplast. By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic working understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The energetics of photosynthesis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The basic workings of the Calvin cycle (including the fixation, reduction, and regeneration phases)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Summary</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;We have finished our discussion of photosynthesis by showing the major anabolic pathway that results in the reduction of carbon dioxide to G3P which can be used to synthesize various sugars (including glucose). The formation of sugars is energetically unfavorable, as can be predicted from the +ΔG for the formation of glucose from carbon dioxide and water. The energy and reducing power for this process comes from the light-dependent reactions, which were presented in the last tutorial.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon dioxide enters the Calvin cycle by being added to the 5-carbon compound called ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP). This reaction, involving the enzyme rubisco, results in a 6-carbon compound that is very unstable and is rapidly split into two, 3-carbon molecules. The resulting 3-carbon compound is activated by phosphorylation (via ATP obtained from the light-driven reactions of photosynthesis), then reduced by NADPH (again, obtained from the light-driven reactions of photosynthesis). After reduction, a 3-carbon molecule, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) exits the cycle. G3P has two fates. Some molecules go on to form more molecules of RuBP (which requires additional ATP; again derived from the light-driven photosynthetic reactions). Some molecules exit the Calvin cycle to form sugars (including glucose).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Real Life Example: The Calvin Cycle and the Global Climate</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The earth’s climate has changed many times over the course of its history (for example, in class we discussed the change from an anaerobic to an aerobic environment that took place about 2 billion years ago as a result of increased photosynthetic activity).&amp;nbsp; Understanding current global climate change is an important area of scientific study. The amount of carbon dioxide, and other so-called “greenhouse gases”, is increasing in the atmosphere and this&amp;nbsp;has resulted in an increase in the mean global temperature. In an attempt to better understand the factors that play a role in global warming, scientists are attempting to learn more about both the natural and anthropogenic inputs and outputs of greenhouse gases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atmospheric carbon dioxide is constantly being fixed into sugars (and other macromolecules), which, in turn, are oxidized back into CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This relationship, on a global scale, is termed the carbon cycle.&amp;nbsp; Through the burning of fossil fuels we are generating CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;at a faster rate than plants can fix them back into sugars and other carbon molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plants and other photosynthetic organisms play an important role in determining the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. They are both consumers and producers of carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What organelle and cellular process enables plants to consume carbon dioxide?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What organelle and cellular process enables plants to produce carbon dioxide?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</body>

    <title>The Three Phases of the Calvin Cycle</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Phase 1:&amp;nbsp; Carbon Fixation
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top of the figure below&amp;nbsp;shows the carbon fixation phase of the Calvin cycle. The five-carbon compound, ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP), is joined with one molecule of carbon dioxide to produce a highly unstable 6-carbon compound. &amp;nbsp; The six-carbon compound that results immediately splits into two molecules, each with three carbons.&amp;nbsp; The enzyme&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;rubisco&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(which is one of the most abundant proteins on Earth), catalyzes this reaction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The carbon dioxide used in the Calvin cycle can get to the chloroplast in several different ways. In algae it simply diffuses through membranes from the surrounding water. In plants the carbon dioxide comes in through pores (stomata) in the leaves. These same pores are where oxygen, produced in the light reactions, escapes into the atmosphere.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EnergyV-Photosynthesis(CalvinCycle)-ReductionoftheTwo,Three-CarbonCompounds"&gt;Phase 2:&amp;nbsp; Reduction of the Two, Three-Carbon Compounds
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first phase of the Calvin cycle, carbon dioxide is fixed into a 6-carbon molecule, which splits into two, 3-carbon molecules. In the second phase (shown in the figure below), the 3-carbon molecules are reduced to&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P)&lt;/strong&gt;, a 3-carbon molecule. Remember, reduction means that electrons are added to the molecule. NADPH, produced during the light-dependent reactions, provides the high-energy electrons for this process.&amp;nbsp; ATP is also used in this anabolic reaction. Thus, the Calvin cycle is energetically tied to the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the reduction phase, some of the G3P leaves the cycle to become sugar, however, most of it is used to regenerate RuBP.&amp;nbsp; Notice that glucose is not produced by the Calvin cycle; rather it is the sugar G3P.&amp;nbsp; This G3P can then be used by the cell as an immediate energy source (to be metabolized in cellular respiration) or used to build glucose molecules that will be used by the plant to build cell walls, starches, and other polysaccharides.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Phase 3: Regeneration of G3P to RuBP
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown in the figures below, the Krebs cycle and the Calvin cycle have some general similarities. Remember, the Krebs cycle regenerates oxaloacetate at the end of one cycle to begin the next. In much the same way, the Calvin cycle regenerates RuBP to begin the next cycle. For every three carbon dioxide molecules that are fixed, three molecules of RuBP were needed. Thus, at the end of the cycle there must be three molecules of RuBP or the cycle would get out of balance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three molecules of RuBP that began the cycle had a total of three carbons multiplied by five molecules, or 15 atoms of carbon. Three molecules of carbon were then fixed for a surplus of three carbons in the cycle. Those three carbons are expelled from the cycle as one molecule of G3P. The remaining 15 carbons are still in the form of G3P. Therefore, they must be converted back to RuBP to start the process again. More ATP, as well as many steps involving enzymes, are necessary for this regeneration.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Overview of the Calvin Cycle</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis produce ATP and NADPH, which are then used in glucose synthesis during the Calvin cycle. As you should know from studying the Krebs cycle, metabolic cycles involve inputs and outputs, and some molecules are recycled to complete the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of the Calvin Cycle, the input molecules are carbon dioxide, ATP, and NADPH. The output molecules are sugar, ADP, NADP+, and inorganic phosphate (Pi). The recycled molecule is&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP&lt;/strong&gt;). Examine the figure below&amp;nbsp;and locate these molecules in the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3910|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EnergyV-Photosynthesis(CalvinCycle)-Calvin'sMethods"&gt;Calvin's Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3914|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific knowledge is gained through observations and controlled experiments, but how does one study a process that can't be seen directly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 50 years ago, Melvin Calvin tried to do just that. He was working in a laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley during WWII. The study of radioactive elements had become an important new field in chemistry during the war. Among these newly discovered radioactive elements was carbon&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;. On the day in 1945 that the Japanese surrendered, a friend and colleague told Calvin, "Now is the time to do something useful with radioactive carbon." Calvin turned his focus to the study of photosynthesis, and 16 years later he won a Nobel Prize in chemistry and a metabolic process was named after him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calvin knew that photosynthesis could only occur in living organisms. Thus, the study of the chemical process was a difficult one. He devised a method whereby he could raise algae (&lt;em&gt;Chlorella pyrenoidosa&lt;/em&gt;) in a lollipop-shaped disk. He set up a stream of air that could be controlled. He could inject radioactive carbon as carbon dioxide into the air stream for a set period of time. Then he would kill the algae with boiling methanol to stop the process of photosynthesis. He ran the experiment multiple times, each time killing the algae at different lengths of time after injecting carbon&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3912|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calvin analyzed the dead algae to determine which molecules had incorporated the carbon&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;. The technique he used is called chromatography. By comparing the molecules that contained carbon&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;after each time period, he found a sequence of compounds that revealed the path of carbon dioxide as it was turned into glucose (you can see an example of the data in the figure). In the years that followed, other researchers have discovered the enzymes and other compounds that also function in the Calvin cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Energetics</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Before we begin our study of the Calvin cycle, let's look at the energetics of sugar synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have already studied the catabolism (breakdown) of glucose during cellular respiration. You know that the process is exergonic and releases about 686 kcal of energy. Thus, the ΔG for the overall reaction is -686 kcal/mole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;glucose + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;--&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + ATP&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If 686 kcal of energy per mole are released in the process of respiration, then it follows that 686 kcal of energy (minimum) are required to produce one mole of glucose. (Remember the first law of thermodynamics?) The Calvin cycle is the process by which glucose is made, and it requires all of that energy. Where does the energy come from? The light reactions of photosynthesis produce ATP, which provides the Calvin cycle with the necessary energy. In addition, the NADPH produced by the light reactions provides the reducing power to put glucose together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;sunlight + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O --&gt; O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ glucose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</body>

&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will begin our discussion of Kingdom Animalia. First, we will discuss what makes an organism an animal. Then, we will focus on some major innovations in the evolution of animals. Then we will discussion animal development (from a single-cell zygote through a specialized embryo). This tutorial will begin our discussion of specific phyla within the kingdom Animalia, beginning with the parazoans and continuing through the acoelomates. As we introduce new topics in animal classification, keep in mind the phylogenetic tree of animals. Also, think about how form (morphology) relates to function. That is, how does an animal's shape and organization affect what it is able to do? This tutorial will provide a more detailed look at the first three major branching points in the phylogenetic tree of animals. The following two tutorials will continue a discussion of animal diversity. By the end of this tutorial you should have an understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The general characteristics of all animals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The origin and early evolution of animals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The major early branching points in the phylogeny of animal evolution&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The basic steps involved in animal development&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Characteristics of organisms in the phyla Porifera, Cnidaria, and Platyhelminthes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The different types of body cavities found in bilateral animals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How certain flatworms can cause disease in humans&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance Objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Summarize the general characteristics of animals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review the evolutionary history of animals and their relationship to protists&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Define tissues, symmetry, cephalization&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the early stages of animal development, including tissue and gut formation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Differentiate between radiata and bilateria, diploblasts and triploblasts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discuss the role of Hox genes in animal development&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discuss the reason for the basal position of sponges in the animal phylogenetic tree and the characteristics of sponges&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain the characteristics of the Radiata&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diagram the three different body cavity types found in the bilateria&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the characteristics of the flatworms and some examples of diseases they cause&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</body>

    <title>Summary</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;This tutorial began our discussion of Kingdom Animalia. Animals have been around for over a billion years, and during this time they have diversified to a remarkable degree. The ancestor of all animals was most likely a colonial protest similar to a choanoflagellate. In examining the animal phylogenetic tree, keep in mind that there are major dichotomous characters that occur at each branch point, including the presence of tissues, the number of tissue layers, and the symmetry of the organism. In&amp;nbsp;some cases&amp;nbsp;these characters are based on the development of animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eumetazoan development (as with other sexually reproducing, multicellular eukaryotes) begins with fertilization. The zygote then undergoes a series of cell divisions to produce a mass of cells that has some hollow character (the parazoans do not follow this type of embryology). The first tissue to form is the blastoderm, and this young tissue surrounds the blastocoel. In the next step (gastrulation), cells migrate inward and begin to differentiate into endoderm. Thus, gastrulation marks the embryonic stage where additional tissue types form. In the case of diploblastic animals, there are only two tissue types (ectoderm and endoderm), whereas triploblastic animals have three tissue types (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm). During gastrulation, the primitive gut also forms from the archenteron. Hox genes are found in all animals and determine the patterning of the body during development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we survey the various phyla of Kingdom Animalia, keep in mind the relationship between these major characters and animal development. This tutorial examined the early branches in the Kingdom Animalia. Be sure that you understand the rationale behind the taxonomic scheme for animals. For example, it is important for you to know what a coelomate is, what the coelom represents, and how the coelom arises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Phylum Porifera was discussed. These animals can be considered individuals and colonies because they have features of both. In fact, there are some biologists who argue that they really aren't animals; however, they do have animal characteristics (they are multicellular, motile, ingestive heterotrophs), which is why they are placed in the kingdom Animalia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phylum Cnidaria is comprised of simple animals, including jellies and corals. These animals do have true tissues, however, they possess only two embryonic tissues; hence, they have a diploblastic mode of development. The major body forms observed in this phylum are the polyp and the medusa. In many cnidarians, these forms alternate during the life cycle, but in Class Hydrozoa the polyp is prominent, whereas in Class Scyphozoa the medusa is prominent. Members of Class Anthozoa do not have a medusa stage (this class includes the coral reef-building animals that form symbioses with dinoflagellates). Think about these differences in terms of evolution because small changes in the expression of developmental genes can control when, and for how long, a given form is represented. Within Phylum Cnidaria, there are differences in the timing of the polyp versus the medusa stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bilateria were introduced in this tutorial. Keep in mind, the character trait bilateral symmetry is observed in animals that actively move through their environments. Bilaterally symmetrical animals not only have a single plane of symmetry, their sensory and cephalic areas are usually cephalized, placed toward the anterior part of the animal. Bilateral animals can be characterized as lacking a body cavity (acoelomates). Those that have a body cavity, coelom, may have one that is incompletely lined with mesoderm (pseudocoelomates), or one that is completely lined with mesoderm (coelomates).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Phylum Platyhelminthes is composed of animals that are commonly referred to as flatworms. These animals are triploblastic and show an organ level of complexity. Although many members of this phylum are free-living, some are parasitic and cause major health problems in some parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Acoelomates: The Phylum Platyhelminthes (Flatworms)</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3953|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our discussion of the bilateria, we begin with those organisms that do not have a body cavity (the acoelomates). These organisms do not have a fluid-filled internal body cavity, but instead, have a relatively solid body mass. Members of the Platyhelminthes include&amp;nbsp;the carnivorous&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;flatworms&lt;/strong&gt;(e.g., planarians). Cephalization occurs in the form of eyespots and paired ganglia, as well as an actual nervous system. Many planarians are capable of regenerating a complete body from a very small fragment if they are cut into pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tapeworms are parasites that consist of a scolex (head), which has hooks for attaching to their host and suckers for extracting food. This&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Taenia serialis&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;was recovered from a dog;&amp;nbsp;you can see the hooks in the center of its head, surrounded by four suckers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flukes&amp;nbsp;are also parasitic. Some&amp;nbsp;flukes exhibit very complex life cycles. Examples include the various species of blood flukes in the family&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Schistosoma&lt;/em&gt;, and the liver fluke depicted&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;C. sinensis&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3955|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3960|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The life cycle of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Schistosoma mansoni&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;fluke in the&amp;nbsp;Phylum Platyhelminthes, is complicated, involving multiple symbioses.&amp;nbsp; This figure shows a copulating pair of male and female&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Schistosoma&lt;/em&gt;. Sexual reproduction occurs inside a vertebrate host (e.g., a human).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3962|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3964|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The life cycle of &lt;em&gt;Schistosoma mansoni&lt;/em&gt; is complex. Fertilized eggs are eliminated in the feces of the first host. The larvae that emerge parasitize a second host, a snail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flukes reproduce asexually within the snails, and their second-stage larvae emerge to infect yet another vertebrate host. The larva exhibit chemotaxis, attracted to vertebrates by the chemicals on their skin surface. After attaching to the skin, the larvae break down skin protein and enter the bloodstream through a venule (located between a capillary and its vein). Once in the bloodstream, the parasite migrates to the lungs, and then the liver. The entire process takes about ten days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3966|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who suffer from schistosomiasis exhibit various symptoms, including a distended abdomen. Other symptoms include pain, extreme diarrhea, and developmental impairment in children. Though the disease has a low mortality rate, but its morbidity is such that schistosomiasis ranks as the second most socioeconomically-devastating disease in the world, after malaria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3968|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who work in or around, freshwater habitats of snails contaminated with human feces are at risk for harboring&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Schistosoma&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and contracting schistosomiasis. The infection can be treated with an annual dose of praziquantel at a cost of about a dollar per person.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;We now turn our attention to those animals that have true tissues and bilateral symmetry, the bilateria. Recall that the bilateria have a single plane of symmetry. In tandem with this single plane of symmetry is the development of advanced sensory material in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;anterior&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(front) part of the body. The eyes of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;planaria,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;an acoelomate,&amp;nbsp;lack the resolution of our own eyes, however, they do detect light. They are connected to a primitive brain (simple brains that contain a low number of neurons are sometimes referred to as ganglia.) The eyes are positioned to perceive new surroundings as the organism moves into new areas. This trend toward a concentration of sensory organs and nervous tissue at the anterior end of an animal&amp;nbsp;is termed&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;cephalization&lt;/strong&gt;. Remember, the bilateria are triploblastic, possessing a third embryonic tissue layer (mesoderm).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bilateria include acoelomates, pseudocoelomates, and coelomates. Acoelomates will be addressed in this tutorial, and the other two will be covered in&amp;nbsp;the following&amp;nbsp;tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AnimalsOne-PhylogenyandDiversity;AnimalswithoutBodyCavities-Parazoa,Radiata,Acoelomates-AcoelomatesversusCoelomates"&gt;Acoelomates versus Coelomates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3915|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third major bifurcation of the animal phylogenetic tree distinguishes animals by whether or not they have a body cavity.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Coelomates&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;have a body cavity, whereas&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;acoelomates&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;do not. Note, there is also a distinction made between&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;pseudocoelomates&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and "true coelomates" (discussed in the next tutorial). A&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;coelom&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a fluid-lined space (body cavity) that separates the gut from the outer body wall. However, don't confuse "body cavity" with "gut" because they are not the same thing. For example, our intestines are suspended within our body cavities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an acoelomate gut, muscle contractions are not buffered by a fluid-filled body cavity; therefore, all forces generated during a contraction are transmitted throughout the animal and affect all internal organs. The coelom serves as a mechanical buffer in coelomates; it helps protect internal organs from shock. Fortunately for us, we can run and jump without bouncing our heart and lungs around too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AnimalsOne-PhylogenyandDiversity;AnimalswithoutBodyCavities-Parazoa,Radiata,Acoelomates-PseudocoelomatesVersusCoelomates"&gt;Pseudocoelomates Versus Coelomates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure&amp;nbsp;below illustrates the body plans of the bilateria. Note the acoelomate, pseudocoelomate and coelomate conditions. Remember, acoelomates do not have a fluid-filled body cavity, while both psuedocoelomates and coelomates have a body fluid-filled body cavity. What advantages does this cavity provide? Do you see that pseudocoelomates (e.g., nematodes) have a body cavity that is only partially lined by mesoderm-derived tissue? In contrast, the coelomates have a body cavity that is completely lined with mesoderm. Keep in mind that mesoderm gives rise to muscle (as well as other organs).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Real Life Example:  Coral Bleaching</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Coral bleaching is the loss of color of coral reefs due to the loss of zoothanthellae algae that live symbiotically within anthozoan corals. Bleaching is a worldwide problem and likely involves many factors. One area of study focuses on how the global warming of ocean waters is creating an unfavorable environment for anthozoan coral-builders and their symbionts. In a healthy coral community the zooxanthellae actively photosynthesize and produce more anabolic products than their own catabolic pathways consume; the excess anabolic products are then passed to the anthozoan coral builders which use the products for activities that include the calcification required to build a coral reef. It has been noted that when the temperature is elevated, Photosystem II can become damaged at high light levels. The causes of the process of bleaching are still under debate and it is not clear whether the zooxanthellae leave the anthozoan on their own, or whether the anthozoan actively rejects the symbiont.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the symbiotic relationship between the zooxanthellae and the anthozoa that live in waters in which they co-evolved and compare this to the symbiotic relationship that now exists in areas experiencing bleaching.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Based upon this information would you predict that coral bleaching increases the evolutionary fitness of the anthozoan host? Why or why not?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Radiata: The Phylum Cnidaria</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3915|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second dichotomous branch point of the animal phylogenetic tree distinguishes between the radiata and the bilateria. The radiata include organisms that have a radial morphology,&amp;nbsp;including Phylum&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Cnidaria&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and and Phylum Ctenophora (in the past these two groups were placed in the Phylum Coelenterata, but we now know that they are separate lineages). Examples of cnidarians include jellies (often called jellyfish), corals, and sea anemones. Some cnidarians are bioluminescent (radiate light), and some (e.g., the Portuguese Man-of-War) can sting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3939|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All cnidarians have true tissues and are members of the Eumetazoa.They have one of two characteristic body plans,&amp;nbsp;the polyp and the medusa and Hox genes are found in their genome. The polyp form is often sessile, anchored to a substrate. The medusa form is mobile. Recall&amp;nbsp;that the radiata have only two embryonic tissue layers. Specifically, they lack mesoderm (the tissue that gives rise to structures, including muscles, in triploblastic organisms). As a consequence, they lack the more sophisticated movement seen in triploblastic organisms, but they do have muscle-like cells at&amp;nbsp;the based of the epithelial (covering) cells&amp;nbsp;that enable them to move by contraction.&amp;nbsp; They have a nerve net that allows them to react more quickly to their environment. Cnidarians have a&amp;nbsp;gastrovascular cavity&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;that is used for both digestion and excretion; the mouth and anus are a single structure. The mesoglea is a jelly-like substance between the two tissue layers that provides support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the Cnidaria include the corals, hydras, jellies and sea anemones.&amp;nbsp; Most species are marine although some hydra are found in freshwater environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3949|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cnidarians&amp;nbsp;have&amp;nbsp;cnidocytes&amp;nbsp;(specialized cells that function in defense and the capture of prey); cnidocytes contain organelles called cnidae, which are able to evert. Cnidae that sting are organelles called&amp;nbsp;nematocysts. These nematocysts can immobilize fish for capture, and they can also be used for defense.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Parazoa: The Phylum Porifera (Sponges)</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3931|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first dichotomous branch point in the phylogenetic tree of animals distinguishes between the parazoans and the eumetazoans; organisms lacking true tissues versus those that have truly specialized tissues.The first phylum we'll discuss&amp;nbsp;are the parazoans of Phylum&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Porifera&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;nbsp;the sponges.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some scientists still question whether sponges are really animals and, if so, are they&amp;nbsp;individuals or colonies of individuals? While sponges are composed of a loose collection of cells, they lack the true tissue-level organization that is characteristic of eumetazoans.&amp;nbsp;There is evidence that supports both choices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AnimalsOne-PhylogenyandDiversity;AnimalswithoutBodyCavities-Parazoa,Radiata,Acoelomates-Sponges:Structure"&gt;Sponges: Structure
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;
  &lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3933|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]

  &lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3935|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sponges are asymmetrical; they do not have a plane that divides them into mirror images. They also do not have true Hox-genes, but do have Hox-like genes that may be involved in body pattern formation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sponges have an epidermis composed of tightly packed cells, underneath which lies a gelatinous matrix and a few specialized cell types that surround a central cavity termed the spongocoel. The spongocoel is connected to the outside via an opening called the osculum. The spongocoel is lined with choanocytes, which are cells that have a central flagellum and a sticky collar that surrounds the flagellum. Which organisms do these cells look like? Water is drawn into the spongocoel through the pores, and food particles in the water may pass the sponge's choanocytes. The flagellum of a choanocyte pulls in food particles, which get stuck in the sticky mucus of the collar and are picked up by amoebocytes. Amoebocytes are mobile and can transport nutrients throughout the body of the sponge. Water then exits the sponge through the osculum.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AnimalsOne-PhylogenyandDiversity;AnimalswithoutBodyCavities-Parazoa,Radiata,Acoelomates-Sponges:Development"&gt;Sponges: Development
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3919|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3937|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sponge has an embryonic form similar to a blastula because it is hollow. One-half of this embryonic form is flagellated, hence the embryo is free-swimming. This hollow, half-flagellated ball will eventually settle and become stuck to a substrate. The flagellated half will invert, and the point where it inverts will become the osculum. The space created during inversion will become the spongocoel. Note that the adult sponge is sessile, whereas the embryonic form is motile.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we mainly use synthetic sponges, natural sponges are still sold for household and artistic use. The photo at right&amp;nbsp;shows how sponges are sold at a market in Crete, Greece

    <title>Animal Development</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3925|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the kingdom Animalia, organisms are primarily grouped according to their development. Early development is conserved across the members of this kingdom. This means that two animals can appear to be very similar when in an early developmental stage but be very different as adults.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is defined as those processes that are irreversible and occur from zygote formation to death. The word "irreversible" is key and limits the definition of development.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Cellular differentiation&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is defined as how a cell diverges from its early morphology into a more specialized morphology, in an irreversible manner.  Morphogenesis is how an organism's "shape" is acquired, and pattern formation describes how cells, tissues, and organs are arranged in an organism.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The embryonic cells of protostomes and deuterostomes have different potentials for future development.&amp;nbsp;Protostomes have blastomeres whose developmental fate is determined very early; hence, their development is termed&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;determinate development&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;Animals that have a radial cleavage pattern (deuterostomes) have blastomeres that can potentially form all tissue types (i.e., their developmental fate is not predetermined); hence, this type of early development is termed&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;indeterminate development&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Totipotency&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the capability of certain embryonic cells to form any type of adult cell. The early embryonic cells (blastomeres) of deuterostomes can be totipotent. Totipotency is required for two individuals to develop from a single zygote that is split in half (e.g., identical twins, also called monozygotic twins). Totipotency is typically lost during early embryo development, but scientists can reprogram some cells to become totipotent once again in the laboratory.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AnimalsOne-PhylogenyandDiversity;AnimalswithoutBodyCavities-Parazoa,Radiata,Acoelomates-FromZygotetoInduction"&gt;From Zygote to Induction
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3927|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of a diploid organism begins with fertilization. Shortly after the gametes unite to form the single-cell zygote, cell division commences. These early cell divisions are called cleavage. Cell division is not a random process, and various patterns of cleavage are observed. In some cases (e.g., protostomes), a spiral pattern is observed in the first few cell divisions, whereas in other cases (e.g., deuterostomes), the&amp;nbsp;blastomeres&amp;nbsp;(early cells) have&amp;nbsp;a radial configuration.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure at right&amp;nbsp;illustrates how the first collection of cells (blastomeres) form a hollow ball, the blastula. However, blastulae aren't always hollow spheres; they can be flattened (e.g., the blastulae of birds and mammals). From this hollow embryonic stage, cells start migrating into the interior&amp;nbsp;and simultaneously begin to differentiate;&amp;nbsp;the cells that migrate inward express a different set of genes. This sets up the first two tissue layers, ectoderm and endoderm. Gastrulation, this movement of surface cells inward, is accompanied by induction (the process by which certain embryonic cells trigger the differentiation of other embryonic cells). During gastrulation, cells change their developmental pathway. The gastrula stage, in which tissue types arise, is only observed in the eumetazoans.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the conclusion of gastrulation, the endoderm and ectoderm have been defined, and the mesoderm then forms. In addition, the archenteron and blastopore arise. The archenteron is a pouch of cells created by invagination during gastrulation, and the blastopore is the opening to the pouch. (In the simplest scenario, think of pushing into a lump of clay &amp;nbsp;with your finger; the area that your finger tip forms (the pouch) represents the archenteron, and its opening represents the blastopore.) The blastopore's fate is determined by the type of organism. If the blastopore gives rise to a mouth, it is a protostome. If the blastopore gives rise to an anus, it is a deuterostome. The gut forms from the archenteron.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="AnimalsOne-PhylogenyandDiversity;AnimalswithoutBodyCavities-Parazoa,Radiata,Acoelomates-Hoxgenesdeterminethebodypatterninanimals"&gt;Hox genes determine the body pattern in animals
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3929|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hox genes&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;are found in animals and determine the pattern formation&amp;nbsp;of the body during the development of the embryo.&amp;nbsp; These genes code for transcription factors, which control the expression of other genes. In animals, these genes are found in a linear sequence along the chromosome, starting with the genes that affect the structure at the head of the organism, and moving down the body.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These genes were first discovered in the fruit fly (an invertebrate model organism) which has one cluster of hox genes, and are now known to be in all animals.&amp;nbsp; They are also well-studied in the mouse (a vertebrate model organism) which has four clusters of hox genes (humans also have four clusters).&amp;nbsp; These additional clusters have taken on new functions, including determining the patterning of the limbs.&amp;nbsp; Mutations in these genes can lead to a change in the postion of body parts, and the results include flies that have legs where their antennae should be!

    <title>Animal Evolution: The Big Picture</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3915|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This figure&amp;nbsp;illustrates the major branch points in the phylogeny (evolutionary history) of animal diversity. Study this figure; you will see it throughout the tutorials on animals. Each of these bifurcations (branch points) is a discrete dichotomous (division of an ancestral line into two equal diverging branches) point. For example, an organism is either a parazoan or a eumetazoan; eumetazoans are either radiata or bilateria (based upon their symmetry; we will discuss this later). Each bifurcation marks a character state that is thought to clearly separate the lineages at that point. The higher you go in the tree, the more derived (or more recently evolved) is each particular character.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AnimalsOne-PhylogenyandDiversity;AnimalswithoutBodyCavities-Parazoa,Radiata,Acoelomates-ParazoaVersusEumetazoa"&gt;Parazoa Versus Eumetazoa
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first dichotomous branching point of the phylogenetic tree of Kingdom Animalia&amp;nbsp;separates organisms that do not have true tissues from those with true tissues. A&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;tissue&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is an aggregation of cells that performs a function.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Parazoans&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;lack true tissues, whereas&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;eumetazoans&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;have true tissues. There has been some debate about whether parazoans, the sponges, should&amp;nbsp;be considered animals; however, molecular data clearly place them at the base of the animal tree. Eumetazoans have distinct collections of cells that are arranged for specific purposes. Thus, the presence of true tissues is the first bifurcation in the animal phylogeny.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it can be easier to see similarities between groups at the larval stage. For example, sponge larva are free-swimming with flagellated cells. &amp;nbsp;As adults, they settle in one place and are no longer mobile; they do retain flagella on some of&amp;nbsp;their cells (we will discuss the structure of sponges in more detail&amp;nbsp;later in this tutorial).&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3919|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Eumetazoans: Radial Versus Bilateral Symmetry
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second dichotomous branch point in the Animal phylogenetic tree&amp;nbsp;separates the eumetazoans with&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;radial symmetry&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;radiata&lt;/strong&gt;) from those with&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;bilateral symmetry&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;bilateria&lt;/strong&gt;). In organisms that possess radial symmetry, multiple mirror image planes can be drawn across the organism’s center (think of slicing a pizza; you can slice at any point to divide the pizza into two equal halves). In organisms that possess bilateral symmetry, only one mirror plane can be drawn along a single axis. For example, humans have only one mirror plane, running from head to toe down the center of the body.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another characteristic of the radiata is that they are&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;diploblastic&lt;/strong&gt;. Diploblastic organisms only have two embryonic tissue layers:&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;endoderm&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;ectoderm&lt;/strong&gt;. The endoderm gives rise to the lining of the digestive tract, and in higher animals, the liver and lungs. The ectoderm gives rise to the animal's outer covering and, in some phyla, the central nervous system. The bilateria are&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;triploblastic&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and begin life with three distinct tissue layers: endoderm,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;mesoderm&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and ectoderm. The mesoderm gives rise to the muscles and most of the internal organs, including the heart and kidneys. We will discuss these tissue types more in the following tutorials. Note that these are embryonic distinctions; this does not mean that these organisms will end up with only two or three tissue types. Some animals that exhibit radial symmetry as adults (for example, the sea stars) have been placed in the bilateria. Why might this be the case?&amp;nbsp;Can an adult morphology&amp;nbsp;differ significantly from the larval morphology of the same animal?&amp;nbsp; Additionally, the radiata tend to be sessile as adults, whereas the bilateria are usually&amp;nbsp;mobile.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AnimalsOne-PhylogenyandDiversity;AnimalswithoutBodyCavities-Parazoa,Radiata,Acoelomates-ProtostomesVersusDeuterostomes"&gt;Protostomes Versus Deuterostomes
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last major branch point of the phylogenetic tree of Kingdom Animalia distinguishes animals with a true coelom (body cavity) based on the fundamental aspects of their development.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Protostome&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;coelomates include the mollusks, annelids and arthropods, whereas&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;deuterostome&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;coelomates include the echinoderms and chordates.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main differences between the two is the origin of the openings to their digestive tract. In protostomes the mouth develops first, whereas in deuterostomes the anus develops first. "Stoma" is Greek for "mouth," and "protos" and "deuteros" are "first" and "second," respectively. We will discuss more about the differences between protostomes and deuterostomes later. These two groups also have other differences in the development of their embryos.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What are Animals?</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3917|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all agree that a cat is an animal, but what is it that makes it an animal? Why is a sponge an animal? Why are sponges and cats placed in the same kingdom? You might think that some corals look more like plants, and that sponges don't look like much of anything; at least, not&amp;nbsp;anything living. Why are these diverse organisms all classified as animals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some basic features that are found in all of the members of the kingdom Animalia. In general, animals are all motile, heterotrophic, and multicellular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motility refers to the ability to move and/or affect motion in&amp;nbsp;the organism's&amp;nbsp;vicinity. For example, adult sponges don't move from place to place, but they&amp;nbsp;have specialized cells that create currents and capture food particles, and other cells that distribute food in their body. Also, while some animals are sessile as adults, all animals exhibit movement from place to place sometime in their development. For example, sponges and corals are motile as&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;larvae&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(the very early stages of embryonic development) and sessile as adults. A myriad of adaptations for motility are observed in animals, and some of these will be addressed in this tutorial. This figure&amp;nbsp;depicts the development of a sponge, with both motile and sessile stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3919|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3921|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animals are ingestive heterotrophs;, they ingest nutrients, bringing them into their bodies for digestion. Unlike plants, which store their food as starch, animals store their food as glycogen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most animals have muscle tissue and nervous tissue. These tissues can range from being simple (as seen in members of the radiata) to being highly complex (as seen in vertebrates). The coordination between muscle tissue and nervous tissue can result in very specialized movements (e.g., getting food, pursuing a mate, avoiding a predator).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AnimalsOne-PhylogenyandDiversity;AnimalswithoutBodyCavities-Parazoa,Radiata,Acoelomates-TheOriginofAnimals"&gt;The Origin of Animals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3923|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first animals likely originated from a colonial protist similar to&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;choanoflagellates&lt;/strong&gt;. Choanoflagellates share some basic feature with animals, the parazoa in particular.&amp;nbsp;This colony of individual cells is anchored to a substrate, and&amp;nbsp;each flagellum sweeps food into a cell for ingestion. The cell can then transfer the food to other cells. While this organism shows little specialization, it&amp;nbsp;displays a very primitive form of multicellularity and ingestive heterotrophy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular data also place&amp;nbsp;choanoflagellates the group of protists most closely related to animals.&amp;nbsp;Animals first appear in the fossil record approximately 750 million years ago, but&amp;nbsp;molecular data suggest that animals&amp;nbsp;evolved much earlier.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tutorial continues our discussion of the major features of animal evolution, concentrating on the bilateria. Previously we introduced three phyla: Porifera, Cnidaria, and Platyhelminthes. These groups include representatives of the parazoa, radiata, and bilateria, respectively. We will begin by distinguishing among the organisms with body cavities, the pseudocoelomates and true coelomates. We will then discuss representative lineages of the protostome coelomates, including molluscs, annelids and arthropods. &amp;nbsp;As you progress through this tutorial, compare and contrast these protostome taxa. &amp;nbsp;How are these groups of animals similar? What morphological and developmental patterns do they have in common? How do they differ? By the end of this tutorial you should have a better understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How specific organisms coincide with the major branch points in the phylogenetic tree in the evolution of animals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Characteristics of organisms in Phyla Nematoda&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How some species of&amp;nbsp;roundworms cause disease&amp;nbsp;in humans&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The members of the Phylum Mollosca, and the constraints a shell imposes on their body plan and development&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The importance of segmentation in the annelids&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why the animals in Phylum Arthropoda are thought to be so successful&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The diversity of ecologies and body plans in the Phylum Arthropoda&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance objectives:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify the two groups of pseudocoelomates, their general characteristics and the human impacts of nematodes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compare and contrast the two groups of animals with true coelems, the protostomes and deuterostomes, including the differences in development seen in these two groups&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discuss the characteristics of the organisms that are members of the Mollusca&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the characteristics of the organisms that are members of the Annelida&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain the characteristics of arthropods that have made them successful&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review the diversity of arthropod groups, including trends in arthropod evolution&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</body>

    <title>Summary</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;This tutorial continued our discussion of the bilateria branch of the kingdom Animalia. When you think about this character (bilateral symmetry), keep in mind that it is observed in animals that actively move through their environment. Bilaterally symmetrical animals not only have a single plane of symmetry, but their sensory and cephalic areas are usually displaced toward the anterior end of the animal. There are two lineages of pseudocoelomates. The nematodes include free-living species as well as many species that are parasites of mammals, while the mostly free-living rotifers are an important part of the zooplankton.&amp;nbsp; The mollucs are very diverse morphologically, ranging from the shell-less slugs to the bivalves with two large shells that are joined at a hinge. &amp;nbsp;Some cephalopods show remarkable levels of intelligence for an invertebrate.&amp;nbsp; The annelids show true segmentation, although their segments do not show extensive specialization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arthropods fall into one of five subphyla. Segmentation, and subsequent specialization, is one of the hallmarks of each of these five groups. Trilobites were a very successful group that became extinct about 250 million years ago. Although these animals were segmented, they had very little diversification in their segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chelicerates include spiders. These animals have two major body segments: the cephalothorax and the abdomen. Their appendages are all clustered in the cephalothorax. Typically there are six pairs of appendages. These include the chelicerae, which are involved in feeding, and the pedipalps, which may have a feeding function. The remaining appendages are walking legs. The members of this group do not have antennae but do have simple eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crustaceans, the second largest extant subgroup, include mostly aquatic species, however, there are some terrestrial species. They have two pairs of sensory antennae, jaw-like mandibles, and compound eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The millipedes and centipedes are myriapods. They have many unspecialized segments, and many pairs of legs. The usually have one pair of antennae and simple eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hexapods are the largest extant subgroup. They have jaw-like mandibles, compound eyes, one pair of sensory antennae, and unbranched (uniramous) appendages. This subgroup includes Class Insecta, which have distinct segments that may be highly specialized. Flight evolved in this group, and is in part responsible for its success and diversity.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Arthropod Diversity</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=4006|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of numbers and the diversity of species, Phylum Arthropoda is the most successful group in Kingdom Animalia. Whether one looks on the land, in the air, or under the sea, they will find representatives from this phylum. Over one million&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;arthropod&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;species have been described to date; of these, about 400,000 are beetles. Some researchers estimate that the number of arthropod species may exceed 10 million.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AnimalsTwo-AnimalswithBodyCavities:PseudocoelomatesandProtostomeCoelomates-CharacteristicsofArthropods"&gt;Characteristics of Arthropods
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=4008|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extreme diversity observed in Phylum Arthropoda can be attributed to three main arthropod characteristics that have evolved into various forms to allow for adaptation to different environments: a hard chitinous exoskeleton, body segmentation, and jointed appendages (the word arthropod means jointed leg)&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arthropod body is covered by a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;cuticle&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;composed primarily of the polysaccharide chitin (the same polymer used by fungi, as was mentioned in the Fungi I tutorial, but with a harder character; chitin was also described in the tutorial Carbon and Life). In crustaceans, the cuticle includes calcium carbonate, the same mineral used in mollusk shells. This exoskeleton demonstrates several features that are adaptations for life in a terrestrial environment. Its durability protects the animals from physical injury. It also provides structural support to the muscles that move the appendages. Lastly, the cuticle is waterproof and helps prevent desiccation in a dry terrestrial environment; the outer cuticle is covered by a thin layer of wax. One drawback of the exoskeleton is that it confines growth, but arthropods deal with this problem by periodically shedding their exoskeletons in a process known as&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;molting&lt;/strong&gt;. The cuticle also creates a barrier to gas exchange. While aquatic arthropods use gills, terrestrial arthropods “breathe” through a series of small holes in the body, spiracles, that lead to trachea, tubes that carry gases into and out of the tissues
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=4010|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arthropods are segmented, and generally there are distinct boundaries between the segments. For example, animals belonging to Class Insecta have three distinct segments: the head, the thorax (sometimes grouped together with the head as the cephalothorax), and the abdomen. The rhinoceros beetle has a cephalothorax and a large abdomen, while an ant has a distinct head and thorax. Typically, these different body regions have distinct functions and often contain various types of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;jointed appendages&lt;/strong&gt;. Jointed appendages afford the animal with a greater degree of movement. In addition to locomotion, the appendages may be adapted for other functions (e.g., feeding, sensory perception, copulation, and defense).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some jointed appendages, such as the swimming appendages of this candy cane shrimp&amp;nbsp;are specialized through adaptation to different and diverse environments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;
  &lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=4012|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;This figure&amp;nbsp;shows the body segmentation (cephalothorax and abdomen) and specialized appendages of a representative arthropod, a lobster. In addition to segmentation, arthropods have an open circulatory system; their “blood” and internal organs are contained within a coelem, the hemocoel.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AnimalsTwo-AnimalswithBodyCavities:PseudocoelomatesandProtostomeCoelomates-PhylumArthropoda:Classification"&gt;Phylum Arthropoda: Classification
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;
  &lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=4016|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=4018|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arthropods are traditionally divided into five subgroups or subphyla: trilobites (an exclusively marine group whose members all are extinct; the fossil record indicates that they were once the dominant subgroup), chelicerates, myriapods, crustaceans, and hexapods. As is the case for many groups of organisms, new molecular datasets are providing additional information on relationships. The groups presented here may change as future molecular data provide a clearer insight into arthropod relationships.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of modern&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;chelicerates&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(e.g., spiders, scorpions, ticks, and mites) are terrestrial arthropods belonging to Class Arachnida. As with the trilobites, most of the marine chelicerates are extinct, even though a few marine members (e.g., the horseshoe crab, members of a separate class) have survived. The arachnids are best distinguished by their claw-like feeding appendages (chelicerae), from which this subgroup gets its name. Another characteristic of the chelicerates is the presence of two body segments (a cephalothorax and an abdomen). The cephalothorax has six pairs of appendages, including four pairs of walking legs, one pair of chelicerae, and one pair of pedipalps, which have either a feeding or sensory function. Chelicerates lack antennae and have simple eyes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;crustaceans&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;make up the second largest arthropod subgroup. Extant species are mainly aquatic animals, although some terrestrial species (e.g., pill bugs and wood lice) are classified within this group. Animals in this class include crabs, lobsters, crayfish and shrimp, and they are the only arthropods with two pairs of antennae. Their appendages have two branches at the tips&amp;nbsp;and sometimes the term birame is used to describe members of this group. Segmentation is obvious and extensive in these animals. In contrast to the chelicerates, crustaceans have jaw-like mandibles and compound eyes. The fiddler crab is a typical crustacean.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;
  &lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=4020|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=4022|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The myriapods include the centipedes and millipedes. All of the members of this group are terrestrial, and they have long bodies with many segments, although the segments lack specialization. They have a single pair of antennae and usually have simple eyes (Fig. 28).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=4024|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;hexapoda&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;(“six legs”), the largest extant subgroup, represent so many individual species that this subgroup accounts for the majority of all known (and probably most of the still undiscovered) animal species on the planet. The hexapods have mandibles and compound eyes (as do the crustaceans). Uniquely, they have only one pair of sensory antennae and their appendages are unbranched or uniramous (the name unirames is sometimes used for this group). The hexapods include Class Insecta, with its twenty-six described orders. Insects first appear in the fossil record about 400 million years ago. Insects have three distinct segments (head, thorax, and abdomen). Two pairs of wings and three pairs of legs are typical. Scientists who study insects are called entomologists. Class Insecta is the largest class in the phylum Arthropoda, and their diversity is unmatched in the animal kingdom. Flight evolved independently in this group (what other types of animals can fly?) and is thought to be one factor in the dramatic success of the insects. Why would flight be correlated with species diversity?
&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3971|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animals in the Phylum Annelida include the earthworms, leeches, and many marine worms. These protostome coelomates exhibit true&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;segmentation&lt;/strong&gt;. Segmentation refers to body plans that are divided into discrete units, which may be repeating or may each have a unique function in the body.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=4002|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to detect segmentation in earthworms. The segments are physically separated internally by thin sheets of mesoderm-derived tissue termed septa (singular: septum; recall, the term septa was also used to describe structures that separate cells in the hyphae of fungi, i.e., septate hyphae). Because of these separations, earthworms can contract muscles in some segments without affecting the hydrostatic pressure in adjacent segments. This ability is highly advantageous for movement, and through coordinated contraction and expansion of segments, earthworms are able to burrow into the soil with ease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=4004|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure at right shows some of the internal segmentation in an earthworm. The bodies of most&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;annelids&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;consist of a series of repeating segments, with repetition of organ systems (muscular, nervous, reproductive, circulatory, and excretory) in the segments. Therefore, most annelids do not capitalize on one of the main benefits of segmentation, the ability to specialize. Note, many segments have multiple hearts, and each segment has a pair of nephridia (an excretory organ). Also note how the longitudinal blood vessels, nerve cords, and digestive tract all run the length of the body, whereas the pumping vessels and ganglia are all arranged in segments. In contrast, some arthropods show extreme specialization by exploiting segmentation.
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Protostome Coelomates: The Phylum Mollusca</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Phylum Mollusca has both aquatic and terrestrial species, and includes clams, snails, octopuses, and sea slugs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Mollusks&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;are characterized by their soft bodies, which are usually protected by a hard calcium carbonate shell. However, this shell can be highly reduced or completely absent in some representatives of the phylum.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;
  &lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3988|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3990|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the gastropods (meaning "stomach foot") include snails, slugs, sea slugs, and nudibranchs. There are terrestrial, marine and freshwater species in this group. Most snails have a coiled shell, however, the shell is completely absent in nudibranchs. Terrestrial gastropods (e.g., snails) lack the gills that are characteristic of other mollusks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3992|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bivalves (“two shells”) are another groups of molluscs that includes mussels, oysters, and clams. They have a reduced head, two hinged shells connected by strong muscles, and a body that is highly modified to fit within these shells.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3994|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__left__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cephalopods (“head foot”) include octopuses, squid, cuttlefish, and chambered nautiluses. The members of this group have a head surrounded by tentacles, which can be used for locomotion and grasping prey. The shells (also called pens) of squid and cuttlefish are reduced and internal. Recent research suggests that cephalopods are intelligent organisms, and British institutional research review boards have gone so far as to enact special ethical protections for squid and octopuses similar to those afforded to higher level vertebrates.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest living&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;invertebrates&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(animals without backbones) are the giant squids, which are extremely elusive and typically only encountered washed-up on the shore. The largest, documented giant squid was 18 meters long. The individual in this photo is 9 feet long.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3996|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AnimalsTwo-AnimalswithBodyCavities:PseudocoelomatesandProtostomeCoelomates-MolluskAnatomy"&gt;Mollusk Anatomy
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3998|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internal anatomy of a representative mollusk (a snail) reveals how much more complex these organisms are than representatives from any of the preceding animal phyla discussed
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, the mollusk body plan consists of a muscular foot, a visceral mass, and a mantle. The foot is used for movement (especially in the gastropods) or as an anchor. The visceral mass houses most of the internal organs (e.g., the stomach, gonads, and heart). The mantle is the tissue layer that covers the visceral mass. In organisms that have shells, the mantle produces the shell. Underneath the mantle is a mouth at one end and a mantle cavity at the other. The mantle cavity houses the anus and gills.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=4000|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mollusks characteristically have a radula (a rasping structure that is used to scrape food particles from hard surfaces). For example, the radula of mollusks cleans algae off of the surfaces in aquariums. Some snails use their radula to drill into the shells of other molluscs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visit the marine aquarium in the HUB&amp;nbsp;on the University Park campus and look for the radula on the underside of the snails cleaning the walls of the tank. &amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coelomates: Protostomes versus Deuterostomes</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3971|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The true coelomates are often categorized as either protostomes or deuterostomes. As we discussed in the previous tutorial, the distinction is based on differences in their early cell cleavage, coelom formation, and the fate of the blastopore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3986|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main differences between these two groups is in the origin of their gut. The mouth develops first in protostomes, whereas in deuterostomes the anus develops first (the mouth forms secondarily). &amp;nbsp;However, recent studies have shown that &amp;nbsp;while some groups of protostomes all have the mouth developing from the blastopore (the Platyhelminthes, Nematodes and Rotifers), in other groups it is most of the species (the Molluscs and Annelids), while only a few Arthropods show this pattern.&amp;nbsp; Those studies also show that while all deuterstomes (Echinoderms and Chordates) have the anus developing from the blastopore, so do most Arthropods. However, Arthropods show the protostome condition for both cleavage&amp;nbsp;and the development of the mesoderm. So, while some of these developmental distinctions may not be as clear cut as we once thought, they can still be useful for categorizing animal diversity. We'll begin our discussion with the coelomate protostomes in the phylum Mollusca.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Pseudocoelomates: The Phylum Nematoda</title>
    <body>[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3971|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roundworms&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;are pseudocoelomates that belong to the phylum &lt;strong&gt;Nematoda&lt;/strong&gt;. This extremely diverse phylum includes some highly beneficial free-living soil worms, as well as some notorious pests and parasites; the members of this group have very diverse ecologies. The fluid-filled pseudocoelom of these animals can function as a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;hydrostatic skeleton&lt;/strong&gt;, which can be useful in drilling through soil or a host's body tissue. Another group that we will study, &lt;strong&gt;Annelids&lt;/strong&gt;, also have hydrostatic skeletons. Rotifers are pseudocoelomates that are an important part of the zooplankton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3977|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3979|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giant kidney worms&amp;nbsp;are able to parasitize many mammals, including humans. The female worms can grow up to 5 feet long. The worms live in the kidney of a vertebrate host, and their eggs leave the body in the host's urine. From there, the eggs might be consumed by an aquatic worm (from the phylum Annelida). Juvenile kidney worms can be transferred to fish or amphibians; if these secondary hosts are consumed by a mammal, the infection cycle is completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given how large these worms can become, it is not surprising that these parasites can cause extensive damage. Note how shrunken the asterisked kidney is, and also note the worms occupying the kidney in the yellow square. The accompanying loss of kidney function can be deadly if the parasites are not detected and surgically removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3981|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=3984|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is estimated that 25% of the world's human population is infected with these roundworms (&lt;em&gt;Ascaris lumbricoides&lt;/em&gt;). This particular worm was passed from the intestine of a human. The ruler at the side is approximately 1.5 inches long. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;nematodes&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;include pinworms, hookworms, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Trichinella spiralis&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(the causative agent of trichinosis). This hookworm mouth&amp;nbsp;reveals how these worms are able to latch on to a host and penetrate the host's intestines and other organs. Symptoms of helminth infections include diarrhea, anemia, pneumonia, as well as physical and mental developmental delays. The World Health Organization (WHO) data suggest that 1/3 of the world’s population is at risk of infection, with one in six people already infected. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AnimalsTwo-AnimalswithBodyCavities:PseudocoelomatesandProtostomeCoelomates-NematodesasModelOrganisms"&gt;A Real Life Example:&amp;nbsp; Nematodes as Model Organisms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a microscopic nematode worm that has been used extensively&amp;nbsp;as a model organism in biology. In the laboratory they are an ideal model organism&amp;nbsp;because they can be maintained in a Petri dish, they eat bacteria, and they can be frozen&amp;nbsp;for extended periods, and when thawed, they are completely viable. They have a clear&amp;nbsp;cuticle through which all of their cells can be seen. All adult&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;have exactly 959&amp;nbsp;somatic cells and the individual developmental path of each of these cells has been&amp;nbsp;mapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is useful in genetic studies because it has a relatively small genome with 5&amp;nbsp;autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes (adult&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;are either hermaphrodites&amp;nbsp;(XX) or males (X)). It is also relatively easy to disrupt the action of individual genes&amp;nbsp;using a procedure known as RNA interference. In this process, the action of individual&amp;nbsp;genes can be “turned off” by using small pieces of RNA (known as small interfering&amp;nbsp;RNA or siRNA) to degrade a complementary piece of mRNA. By “turning off” a gene,&amp;nbsp;researchers can learn more about the function of that gene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;C. elegans’ natural habitat is soils. What feature does&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(and other&amp;nbsp;nematodes) have that allow them to move through soils?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is used as a model organism to study biological phenomena in humans (for example, aging, sleep, and disease). &amp;nbsp;Describe one characteristic of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;that makes it a useful model for these phenomena. &amp;nbsp;Describe one drawback to using&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;as a model for human biology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How many different chromosome combinations can a hermaphrodite&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;produce as result of independent assortment during meiosis?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coelomates and Pseudocoelomates</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The figure below&amp;nbsp;illustrates the three basic body plans encountered in the bilateria: the acoelomates (e.g., flatworms, flukes, and tapeworms), the pseudocoelomates (e.g., roundworms, pinworms, hookworms and rotifers), and the coelomates (e.g., snails, clams, octopuses, earthworms, and leeches). Recall that&amp;nbsp;pseudocoelomates differ from coelomates in that their body cavities are not completely lined by mesoderm-derived tissue, but instead have mesoderm only on one side, with endoderm on the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This final tutorial covering&amp;nbsp;animal diversity&amp;nbsp;examines the deuterostomes.&amp;nbsp; There are two major phyla in this group, the Echinodermata and the Chordata. Phylum&amp;nbsp;Chordata contains three subphyla: Vertebrata, Cephalochordata, and Urochordata. We will explore the features that characterize these phyla and how these structures have evolved for multiple&amp;nbsp;purposes. By the end of this tutorial you should have an understanding of the:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;embryonic characteristics of deuterostomes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;major characteristics of echinoderms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;major characteristics of chordates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;characteristics of organisms within the invertebrate subphyla of the chordates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;characteristics of organisms within the vertebrate subphylum of the chordates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance Objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the characteristics of the echinoderms and discuss why they are members of the bilateria&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify the characteristics of chordates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compare and contrast the cephalochordates and urochordates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explain characteristics of vertebrates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Describe the characteristics of the major groups of vertebrates, including adaptations to terrestrial environments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</body>

    <title>Summary</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;The deuterostomes include the echinoderms and the chordates. The echinoderms are an exclusively marine group that show five-fold radial symmetry as adult, but are bilaterally symmetrical as larvae. They have an endoskeleton and are covered with a spiny skin.&amp;nbsp; They have a complex water vascular system that hydraulically powers their movement using tube feet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Phylum Chordata contains the subphyla Urochordata, Cephalochordata, and Vertebrata. Individuals within the phylum all have a notochord, a dorsal nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a postanal tail. The notochord may or may not persist in the adult, and the pharyngeal slits are modified in various ways in the different groups. The Urochordates are the probable ancestors of vertebrates. Vertebrates have a dorsal nerve cord that is protected by a vertebral column, and the anterior portion of this nerve cord is protected by a cranium. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are several basal features found in vertebrates, and they are used to distinguish the lineages. The presence or absence of jaws, teeth, lungs, legs, amniotic eggs, and hair are more derived features that arose in succession, and they give the vertebrates the diversity seen today, including our own species.

    <title>Mammals</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;This armadillo belongs to the vertebrate class Mammalia, as does this panther.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Mammals&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;can be distinguished from the other vertebrates on the basis of several characteristics. All mammals have hair that functions (to some degree) for insulation, three bones in their inner ear that increasing hearing sensitivity, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;mammary glands&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;for milk production, and internal fertilization. Most mammals develop in the maternal uterus and are nourished by nutrients diffusing from mother to child across an organ called the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;placenta&lt;/strong&gt;. Young&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;marsupial&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;mammals complete their development in a maternal pouch; marsupials include kangaroos, opossum, and Tasmanian Devils. A few animals (e.g., the echidna and the platypus) are&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;monotremes&lt;/strong&gt;, which are mammals that lay eggs and lack nipples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans are vertebrates, and we are subject to the same evolutionary principles that govern all life on the planet. However, we are a relatively new species. Although our genus&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;first arose almost 2.5 million years ago, modern humans,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(those that learned agriculture and demonstrated tool use and complex social structure) date back to a mere 150,000 to 200,000 years ago. While this may sound like a long time ago, consider that this represents only 5000 generations. This is not long on an evolutionary scale. This figure shows the major migration paths prior to 10,000 years ago, and all of us can trace our own ancestry back to one or more of these migrations.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Phylum Chordata: Subphylum Vertebrata</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Subphylum Vertebrata includes organisms with several basic features, in addition to the typical chordate characteristics. Vertebrates exhibit the most pronounced cephalization, in which the anterior portion of the nervous system (the brain) is enclosed inside a protective case (the skull). These animals all have a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;vertebral column&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(backbone), an axial endoskeletal system that forms dorsally to the notochord. &amp;nbsp;This system serves to protect the dorsal nerve cord, support the head, anchor muscles, and protect internal organs.&amp;nbsp; The anterior portion of this nerve cord is protected by a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;cranium&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;in all of the vertebrates.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=4025|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure at right&amp;nbsp;illustrates the evolutionary relationships among members of Phylum Chordata. As you look at the evolution of the group, note the acquisition of the more derived features: jaws, teeth, lungs, legs, amniotic eggs, and hair. We will explore these features (and their origins) in more detail in this tutorial.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AnimalsThree-AnimalswithBodyCavities:Deuterostomes-EchinodermsandChordates-EvolutionofTheJaw"&gt;Evolution of The Jaw
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During vertebrate evolution, many modifications have occurred in the pharynx. If you have an opportunity to take a class in mammalian embryology, you will learn that many structures are derived from different regions of the embryonic pharynx (e.g., human nostrils originate from pharyngeal slits, which are present in the early human embryo). We will examine the evolution of the jaw so that you can appreciate how evolutionary biologists think these more derived structures evolved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=4053|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These jaw images&amp;nbsp;are arranged left to right, with the more ancestral state on the left and the more derived state on the right. In the ancestral state, endoskeletal elements are seen in the pharyngeal arches between the pharyngeal slits. It is likely that in this configuration the endoskeleton evolved to support the pharyngeal slits. However, in an event that probably involved a change in the growth of the more anterior arches, the endoskeletal elements became thicker and surrounded the mouth; primitive jaws appeared. These likely allowed the fish to capture food more effectively. In the most derived state (depicted on the right), further changes took place and these anterior bones became thicker and new bony protuberances appeared in the form of teeth. Teeth made predation more efficient, and are found in many vertebrates; most vertebrates that lack teeth are very specialized feeders, consuming food that does not need to be “handled”, including nectar, blood and termites/ants.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should recognize this gradual adaptation of existing structures for new purposes as a reoccurring theme in evolution. The evolution of other pharyngeal structures, which gave rise to lungs and their derivatives, has also contributed significantly to vertebrate evolution.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AnimalsThree-AnimalswithBodyCavities:Deuterostomes-EchinodermsandChordates-EvolutionofLegsandtheAmnioticEgg"&gt;Evolution of Legs and the Amniotic Egg
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legs and amniotic eggs are two additional derived characters that have played a significant role in the evolution of vertebrates. The significance of legs in the terrestrial environment is obvious. How do evolutionary biologists think they evolved?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=4055|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The endoskeletal system of vertebrates consists of the axial elements that are associated with the vertebral column. In addition, more lateral elements, termed the appendicular skeletal system, are found in some groups. The fossil record indicates that the appendicular skeletal system first appeared in a group of fish that have more robust&amp;nbsp;fins with a main boney element, the "lobefin" fishes. (as opposed to the light, ray-like boney elements in the rayfin fishes) &amp;nbsp;A progressive thickening of these elements occurred. The fossil record (and other data) indicates that the tetrapods, terrestrial vertebrates, arose from lobefin fish, and that legs evolved from these highly modified lobe fins.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early vertebrates arose in the oceans, where desiccation was not a problem. However, with the invasion of land about 365 million years ago, ancient vertebrates had another problem to face, water loss. This was similar to the problem faced by land plants. The vertebrates evolved a toughened egg that was resistant to drying, the amniotic egg, which would have been selectively advantageous in a drier environment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=4057|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reptiles, birds and mammals, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;amniotic egg&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;has several unique features, including a specialized membrane system that has many functions, including gas exchange and the transfer of vital nutrients to the developing embryo, and a protective and porous shell. The amniotic egg is name for the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;amnion&lt;/strong&gt;, a membrane that surrounds the embryo and contains amniotic fluid, which bathes and protects the embryo.

    <body>&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=4041|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chordates&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;are a group of deuterostomes&amp;nbsp;that show a number of complex adaptations. They have four major characters that distinguish them from other deuterostomes: a notochord, a dorsal nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a postanal tail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dorsal, hollow&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;nerve cord&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is basically a sheet of ectoderm rolled into a tube. A chordate's nerve cord develops into the brain and spinal cord in adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just below the nerve cord is the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;notochord&lt;/strong&gt;, which exists in all chordate embryos, and some adults. The notochord is a long flexible rod that provides&amp;nbsp;support. In vertebrates, it becomes part of the intervertebral discs in adults. Typically the muscles surrounding the notochord are arranged in distinct segments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;pharyngeal slits&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;are openings in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;pharynx&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(part of the throat) of an animal. In the most primitive state these slits allow water to enter the mouth and exit without passing through the digestive system. In the more derived state the pharyngeal slits (and the tissue between them, the pharyngeal arches) serve various functions, ranging from gas exchange to food collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point in their development, all chordates have a tail that extends beyond the anus (a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;postanal tail&lt;/strong&gt;). As with all of these basic chordate characteristics, the tail can be present in the developing embryo and absent in the adult (depending on the type of organism).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AnimalsThree-AnimalswithBodyCavities:Deuterostomes-EchinodermsandChordates-ChordateSubphyla"&gt;Chordate Subphyla&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three subphyla within Phylum Chordata: Vertebrata, Cephalochordata, and Uroochordata. All cephalochordates and urochordates are&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;invertebrates&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(animals without backbones), as were all of the animals discussed in the previous tutorials. All members of the Subphylum Vertebrata are&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;vertebrates&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;(animals with backbones).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subphylum&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Cephalochordata&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;includes the cephalochordates (lancelets), which are small marine animals that burrow, tail first, into the sand. In this position they are able to draw food particles into their mouths via their waving tentacles.&amp;nbsp; These animals are classified as chordates because they have all four&amp;nbsp;of the chordate characteristics and, unlike the other chordate groups, they retain all four&amp;nbsp;characteristics through adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="row"&gt;&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=4043|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="col s12 l6"&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=4045|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__lightboxed]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subphylum&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Urochordata&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;includes the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;tunicates&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;("sea squirts"), which are marine animals that are typically sessile as adults. The lightbulb tunicates in the figure above are adhering to coral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adult tunicate&amp;nbsp;does not appear to possess most of the standard chordate characteristics. However, the larval stage&amp;nbsp;clearly exhibits chordate characteristics; note the notochord, the hollow nerve cord, the pharyngeal gill slits, and the postanal tail. In adults the gill slits are modified for filter feeding. Molecular evidence supports the idea that the urochordates are the group most closely related to the vertebrates.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Phylum Echinodermata</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Representatives of the phylum Echinodermata are common inhabitants of coastal tide pools (you can see some of them in the saltwater aquarium at the HUB). Sea lilies, sea stars, sea cucumbers, and most other&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;echinoderms&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;are sessile or slow-moving animals. Some representatives are instantly recognized by their five-fold symmetry (having rays and/or arms in fives or multiples of five). Even though the seemingly radial symmetry of these adult animals would lead one to question their placement in the bilateria, the bilateral symmetry of the larval stage of these animals indicates that they are members of the bilateria lineage. Furthermore, these animals are coelomates since they have a large, fluid-filled cavity lined with mesoderm and usually a complete gut. Many species of sea stars have the ability to turn their stomachs inside out by everting them through their mouths. This allows them to initiate the digestion of their prey before food enters their digestive tract.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=4031|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A thin skin overlaying a hard, yet flexible,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;endoskeleton&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;composed of calcium carbonate plates and spines characterizes the exterior of echinoderms (the name means spiny skin). These plates have a very complex arrangement. Electron microscopy of the surface of a sea urchin demonstrates this elegant arrangement, a sponge-like mesh which creates a plate that allows for special structures to protrude through the endoskeleton for locomotion, feeding, gas exchange, and protection. These protrusions, typically described as tube feet (sucker-like appendages), enable echinoderms to move and provide them with the ability to grip and manipulate objects or prey.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Echinoderms also have a unique water vascular system (a network of hydraulic canals extending in from the tube feet and around the gut of the organism). This expansive network uses hydraulic pressure to manipulate the extension of the tube feet as the animal breathes, feeds, or moves across the ocean floor.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AnimalsThree-AnimalswithBodyCavities:Deuterostomes-EchinodermsandChordates-PhylumEchinodermata:Classification"&gt;Phylum Echinodermata: Classification
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the phylum Echinodermata are diverse. In the adult state it is often unclear how these animals are related. However, a close inspection of their anatomy and embryology reveals their common evolutionary history. Shown here&amp;nbsp;are members from four echinoderm classes (you will not be tested on these classes).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="AnimalsThree-AnimalswithBodyCavities:Deuterostomes-EchinodermsandChordates-WhatDoHumansHaveInCommonWithSeaUrchins?"&gt;What Do Humans Have In Common With Sea Urchins?
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationships between humans and sea urchins may not be obvious, however, common embryonic features reveal their common ancestry. As you have learned, stages of embryonic development have an important place in the classification of animal phyla. Whether it is the fate of the blastopore, the number of germ layers (diploblastic versus triploblastic), or the formation and origin of the tissue lining the body cavity, embryonic origins provide information about the relationships among members of the Kingdom Animalia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The close phylogenetic relationship of humans (and other chordates) and echinoderms is also supported by DNA sequence data. As more data are collected, these relationships will be refined, but to date the evidence of the relationship between the species of these groups is compelling. Some scientists have even discussed placing Phylum Echinodermata closer to Phylum Chordata, or even within Phylum Chordata, due to the discovery of some early echinoderms that might have possessed pharyngeal slits and a tail (diagnostic chordate features). Furthermore, undiscovered species may also provide information on the relatedness of chordates and echinoderms. From what you have learned, would a modern representative of these groups shed more light on this question, or could just as much be learned from the fossil of an adult animal? Why or why not?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Other Coelomates: Deuterostomes</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;To understand the evolutionary history of animals, scientists rely on several types of data including, but not limited to, the following: the overall morphology of the organism, DNA sequence comparisons, other similarities at the molecular level, and the developmental sequence of events in the embryo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ciscode|rev=1|tool=elmsmedia|item=4029|entity_type=node|render=display_mode|display_mode=image__right__lightboxed]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sequence of events during embryonic development is the main characteristic used to distinguish protostomes and deuterostomes. Review the figure at right, which shows the major developmental characters that distinguish a protostome from a deuterostome. Recall that, in general, in protostomes the mouth forms first, whereas in deuterostomes it forms secondarily (the two names are based upon this difference). Another important distinction is how the coelom forms; in protostomes it forms from a splitting of the mesoderm, whereas in most deuterostomes the coelom forms from mesodermal outpocketings of the archenteron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial we will focus on the two major deuterostome phyla, Echinodermata and Chordata.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Carbon and Life Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;Water is essential to life as we know it.&amp;nbsp; It is a strange substance with special properties that allow it to be found normally on earth in all three states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water is so integral to our understanding of life that when we look for life on other planets - we look for signs of water.&amp;nbsp; Launched in August 2007, the Phoenix Mars Mission was designed to study the history of water and habitability potential in the Martian arctic's ice-rich soil.&amp;nbsp; In May of 2010 the Phoenix Mars Lander ended operations due to excessive ice damage to the lander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;The molecular formula of water is H20 - two hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to an oxygen atom. Oxygen is highly electronegative - this means that it tends to attract electrons and thus the oxygen end of the water molecule has a slight negative charge.&amp;nbsp; The hydrogen end of the molecule has a slight positive charge.&amp;nbsp; This distribution of charge across the molecule makes water a polar molecule. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This distribution of charge also results in the formation of hydrogen bonds between the positively charged hydrogen end of a water molecule and the negatively charged oxygen end of neighboring water molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;The hydrogen bonds that form between water molecules make the water molecules stick together.&amp;nbsp; This contributes to some of the unique properties of water that make life possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, water has cohesion - which means that the water molecules stick together.&amp;nbsp; The result is that there is surface tension at the surface of water (whether a pond, a glass of water, or a drop of water).&amp;nbsp; This surface tension can be used by some organisms as a walking surface - such as water striders that can walk on water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water also has adhesion - which means that the water molecules will stick to another surface - such as the surface of a leaf or inside the vascular tissue of a plant.&amp;nbsp; This adhesion allows plants to transport water (using capillary action) from the soil all the way to the leaves so photosynthesis can take place.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;Water also has high specific heat and a high heat of vaporization.&amp;nbsp; The specific heat is the amount of heat per unit mass required to raise the temperature by one degree Celsius.&amp;nbsp; The specific heat of water is 1 calorie/gram which is higher than any other common substance. As a result, water plays a very important role in temperature regulation.&amp;nbsp; This is particularly important near large bodies of water like the oceans - the oceans play an important role and regulating the global temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heat of vaporization is the amount of heat required to convert unit mass of a liquid into the vapor without a change in temperature.&amp;nbsp; The heat of vaporization of water is higher than other common substances - this helps us to cool ourselves during hot weather.&amp;nbsp; When we sweat, our skin becomes covered with water.&amp;nbsp; If humidity is low, this water evaporates easily.&amp;nbsp; The heat energy needed for this evaporation comes from our bodies - so sweating and evaporative cooling cools our bodies.&amp;nbsp; The higher the humidity - the more water there is in the air - and the less evaporation takes place.&amp;nbsp; This is why it is hard to cool down on hot, humid days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid water is less dense than liquid water - this is also an usual property for matter to have.&amp;nbsp; The result is that ice floats and organisms can live under the ice.&amp;nbsp; If ice sank - bodies of water would tend to freeze solid in the winter and organisms could not survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;Water is also an excellent solvent - which means that many things dissolve in water.&amp;nbsp; For example, when you put crystalized salt and sugar in water - it dissolves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, water is not a perfect solvent - which is basically a good thing but can sometimes have negative consequences.&amp;nbsp; It is a good thing because we would not want our skin and bones to dissolve in water - life would not be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is a bad thing when nonsoluble hydrocarbons (these are nonpolar chains of carbon and hydrogen) get released into the water.&amp;nbsp; This is what happens in an oil spill - oils are hydrocarbons and all hydrocarbons behave hydrophobically - they do not interact with water.&amp;nbsp; When organisms become coated in oil - that oil cannot wash off because it does not interact with the water.&amp;nbsp; The result is that the animal can become weighted down by the oil and drown, or the oil can disrupt the natural coating on an animal such as a bird and leave the bird suseptible to becoming too cold or too hot.&amp;nbsp; Some animals will ingest the oil in an effort to clean themselves - the oil is toxic and can cause death.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Carbon and Life Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;Carbon has four electrons in its outermost orbital - but there is room for 8 electrons in this shell. This valence of four allows each carbon atom to form stable associations with up to four other atoms, including other carbon atoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;Carbon can form single, double, or triple bonds. That is, it can share one, two, or three of its valence electrons with another atom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allows carbon to serve as the backbone for an almost endless array of organic molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;Long chains of carbon atoms are common. The chains may be branched or form rings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;Metabolism is the set of chemical reactions that happen in living organisms to maintain life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These processes allow organisms to grow and reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anabolism uses energy to construct components of cells and&lt;br&gt;catabolism breaks down organic matter, for example to harvest energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;The normal functioning of cells and organisms requires both anabolic and catabolic reactions. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most macromolecules are polymers - long chains of repeating units.&amp;nbsp; These polymers are built up during anabolic dehydration reactions (sometimes referred to as condensation reactions).&amp;nbsp; During dehydration synthesis - a molecule of water is lost as covalent bond is formed between the exising polymer and a monomer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymers are broken down during catabolic hydrolysis reactions.&amp;nbsp; A hydrolysis reaction uses a molecule of water to break a covalent bond between two units in a polymer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we talk more about the activities inside a cell we will see that polymers are always being built up and broken down to maintain life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Carbon and Life Part 3 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;Carbohydrates are commonly referred to as sugars.&amp;nbsp; The monomers of carbohydrates are the monosaccharides or simple sugars.&amp;nbsp; Examples of monosaccharides are glucose and fructose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide2&lt;br&gt;Simple sugars join together to make more complex disaccharides - sugars made of two monosaccharides.&amp;nbsp; An example is sucrose which is table sugar or lactose - the sugar found in dairy products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;Polysaccharides are long chains of monosaccharides.&amp;nbsp; For example the starches are long chains of glucose monomers.&amp;nbsp; The difference between the different types of starches shown on this image is the way the glucose units are linked together. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starches are polysaccharides that are mainly used for energy storage.&amp;nbsp; Plants store energy as starches - when you eat a potato or a carrot you are eating the plants energy stores that it could use later to fuel cellular metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glycogen is an animal starch that is mainly stored in the liver and muscle cells.&amp;nbsp; Endurance athletes "hit the wall" when their glycogen stores are depleted.&amp;nbsp; For marathon runners this is usually around the 20 mile mark - part of marathon training is to train the body to use glycogen efficiently.&amp;nbsp; Carboloading (or eating lots of carbohydrates) before an event is one way to help avoid glycogen depletion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;Structural polysaccharides help provide structural support to cells and organisms.&amp;nbsp; Plant cells have strong cell walls made of cellulose which is a long chain of repeating glucose units. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fungi and some animals use a structural polysaccharide known as chitin to provide structural support.&amp;nbsp; Animals like this fiddler crab have a hard exoskeleton made of chitin - this exoskeleton provides strong support for muscles as well as protection against drying out and being damaged by predators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;The lipids are commonly referred to as fats.&amp;nbsp; One important distinction between the lipids and the other macromolecules is that the lipids are not polymers.&amp;nbsp; All of the other macromolecules are polymers.&amp;nbsp; The lipids are structurally diverse but they all share the characteristic that they are hydrophobic or repelled by water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;The dietary fats or triacylglycerols are comprised of a glycerol bonded to three fatty acid chains.&amp;nbsp; A fatty acid is a long chain of carbons and hydrogens.&amp;nbsp; This is a very energy rich molecule - the fats are an excellent source of calories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7&lt;br&gt;The dietary fats can be described as being either saturated or unsaturated.&amp;nbsp; Saturated fats tend to be solid at room temperature like butter or lard.&amp;nbsp; The saturated fats are defined as having only single bonds between the carbons of the hydrocarbons.&amp;nbsp; This means the fatty acids are saturated with carbon atoms.&amp;nbsp; The linear structure of these fatty acids allow them to pack tightly and are usually solid at room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unsaturated fats have at least one double bond between two carbon atoms in the fatty acid chains.&amp;nbsp; The result is a kink in the structure of the fatty acid - the chains can't pack as tightly and the unsaturated fats tend to be liquid at room temperature.&amp;nbsp; Vegetable oils and fish oils are examples of unsaturated fats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 8&lt;br&gt;The phospholipids are strcuturally similar to the dietary fats in that there is glycerol attached to two fatty acid chains.&amp;nbsp; The phospholipids are the main component of cell membranes.&amp;nbsp; They have a hydrophilic water-loving head region and a hydrophobic water-repelling tail region. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 9&lt;br&gt;When phospholipids are placed in water the hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions interact with the water to make a bilayer.&amp;nbsp; The hydrophilic heads align themselves so they are in contact with the water while the hydrophobic tails align themselves so that they are buried inside the bilayer and away from the water.&amp;nbsp; This bilayer is the main component of our cell membranes and it regulates the movement of other essential molecules in and out of the cell.&amp;nbsp; Hydrophobic - hydrophilic interactions are very important in biology - we will see more examples of these interactions as we move through the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 10&lt;br&gt;The final group of lipids are the steroids.&amp;nbsp; Structurally they are very different from the dietary fats and phospholipids.&amp;nbsp; The steroids are characterized by a fused ring structure and the sex hormones are an example of steroids.&amp;nbsp; We can look at the structures of testosterone and estrogen to illustrate an important point in biology.&amp;nbsp; Subtle changes in structure can lead to very different functions or chemical behaviors.&amp;nbsp; Estrogen and testosterone are structurally very similar but they have very different effects on an organism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 11&lt;br&gt;We can see an example of these different effects by observing a bird that has a condition known as bilateral gynandromorphy.&amp;nbsp; The two outer birds are normal - the one on the left is a male evening grosbeak and the one on the right is a female.&amp;nbsp; The one in the middle is both male and female - male on the left half and female on the right half.&amp;nbsp; This condition results from a mistake in mitosis in early embryonic development.&amp;nbsp; This mistake causes the sex chromosomes to distribute abnormally.&amp;nbsp; The left side of the bird is male and thus more sensitive to testosterone.&amp;nbsp; The right side of the bird is female and thus more sensitive to estrogen.&amp;nbsp; The dramatically different sides of this bird are due to the dramatically different behaviors of estrogen and testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 12&lt;br&gt;This phenomenon has been observed not only in birds but in insects like this butterfly and crustaceans like this crab.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Carbon and Life Part 4 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;The proteins are a structurally very diverse group of macromolecules but they are all comprised of a group of 20 similar monomers.&amp;nbsp; The monomers are collectively known as amino acids.&amp;nbsp; An amino acid is a central carbon atom covalently bonded to an amino group, a carboxyl group, and a variable group indicated with the letter R.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;The variable position is filled with one of these 20 different R groups to make 20 different amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The R-groups can be classified as being either nonpolar, polar or electrically charged.&amp;nbsp; The nonpolar groups behave hydrophobically - they are repelled by water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The polar and electrically charged R groups behave hydrophilically - they are attracted to water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later we will see how these hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions can result in either normal function of a protein and optimal health or abnormal protein function and serious health problems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;Amino acids link together to produce a polypeptide - also known as a protein.&amp;nbsp; Proteins are long polymers of amino acids and just as we saw with the steriods - subtle changes in structure can result in dramatic changes in function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;While proteins are long chains of amino acids - they typically do not remain in a linear structure.&amp;nbsp; Instead, most protiens fold in precise 3-dimensional shapes.&amp;nbsp; It is these very precise three dimensional shapes that give a protein its precise function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;The nucleic acids are polymers of nucleotides.&amp;nbsp; The nucleic acids include the genetic material DNA and RNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nucleotide is a central sugar bonded to a nitrogenous base and a phosphate group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central sugar can be either deoxyribose (as it is in DNA nucleotides) or ribse (as it is in RNA nucleotides). &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nitrogenous bases can be either Adenine, guanine, cytosine or thymine in DNA.&amp;nbsp; An RNA molecule has the same nitrogenous bases except RNA uses Uracil instead of Thymine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;DNA molecules are double stranded molecules that are conneceted via hydrogen bonds between complementary nitrogenous bases.&amp;nbsp; The base pairing rules are that Adenine pairs with thymine and guanine pairs with cytosine.&amp;nbsp; Understanding these base pairing rules will be important when we look at the structure and function of DNA in more detail later in the course..&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Antiquity of Life Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1:&amp;nbsp; As we begin our discussion of living organisms, it is important to remember that life has been on earth for a long time.&amp;nbsp; And over billions of years of evolution many different types of organisms have appeared on earth and many have gone extinct. Throughout these 3.5 billion years it is important to remember that the earth's climate and the earth's land masses have changed as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This movement of the land masses is known as plate tectonics and results in continental drift.&amp;nbsp; The image on this slide shows you some of the movement of the land masses over time. The constant changing of the environments on earth is one of the factors that causes the evolution of organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2:&amp;nbsp; The fossil evidence indicates that life on earth began about 3.5 billion years ago.&amp;nbsp; And we know that from a common ancestor, all other life forms arose.&amp;nbsp; This process of evolution has been occurring over the billions of years that life has existed on earth and has resulted in the vast biodiversity that we see on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3:&amp;nbsp; The National Science Foundation's "Tree of Life" Project estimates that there could be anywhere from 5 million to 100 million species on the planet.&amp;nbsp; But currently science has only identified about 2 million of these species. This means that there are still millions of species left to be discovered -&amp;nbsp; most of them residing in what are known as "biodiversity hotspots" such as tropical rain forests and coral reefs.&amp;nbsp; Many other new species are being described as we gain the ability to explore new environments - such as the deep ocean floors which until relatively recently were inaccessible to us.&amp;nbsp; Another aspect of the evolution of the life on earth is extinction.&amp;nbsp; Many species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in a changing environment or when they are outcompeted for resources by another species.&amp;nbsp; Biologist estimate that about 99.9% of all species that ever existed have gone extinct.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately we sometimes can witness extinctions happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4:&amp;nbsp; An example of this may be white nose syndrome in bats.&amp;nbsp; White nose syndrome is a little understood fungal disease that is affecting some species of bats - predominantly in the northeastern United States.&amp;nbsp; While many people find bats to be creepy - they do perform an important ecological service - they eat lots and lots of insects.&amp;nbsp; Including insects like mosquitoes which are notorious for carrying human diseases like West Nile disease. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White nose syndrome was discovered in 2006 in a cave in New York state when bats were found with a distinct white growth on their noses and wings.&amp;nbsp; You can see these white growths on some of the bats on this slide.&amp;nbsp; The bat to the far left of the image does not have white nose syndrome.&amp;nbsp; The name white nose syndrome comes from the fungal growth and the fungus digests tissue on the noses and wings of the bats.&amp;nbsp; This wakes the bats from hibernation and causes severe metabolic destruction which is often fatal for the bat - mortality is upwards of 90%.&amp;nbsp; The disease began in the northeastern part of the US but unfortunately in 2010 was found west of the Mississippi.&amp;nbsp; One species of bat - the little brown myotis - may go extinct in the next 20 years if the spread of this disease cannot be controlled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5:&amp;nbsp; The topic of this tutorial is the antiquity of life and much of what we know about organisms that lived a long time ago is from the fossil record.&amp;nbsp; Fossils are the preserved remains of organisms from the past.&amp;nbsp; All of the known fossils are collectively referred to as the "fossil record".&amp;nbsp; It is this record of life that allowed early biologists to begin to tell the story of life on earth.&amp;nbsp; Only some organisms are represented in the fossil record.&amp;nbsp; Most fossils are found in sedimentary rock which is rock formed by layers of minerals that settle in water.&amp;nbsp; So organisms that live in or near water (like lakes and swamps and oceans) are most abundant in the fossil record. There are gaps in the fossil record because the fossil record is biased toward certain types of organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6:&amp;nbsp; Certain types of organisms are known to fossilize more readily than others. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7:&amp;nbsp; In general, it is organisms with hard body parts that are found predominantly in the fossil record.&amp;nbsp; Organisms like this fiddler crab that has a hard exoskeleton.&amp;nbsp; Fiddler crabs and other arthropods are abundant in the fossil record while other organisms with soft body parts - such as a plant or a jellyfish - are relatively rare in the fossil record.&amp;nbsp; So the fossil record is a nice record of life on earth but is not a perfect record because of that bias. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;Understanding the story of life on earth means not just understanding all of the different kinds of organisms, but also understanding the ages of these organisms.&amp;nbsp; The fossil record can provide information about when different types of organisms first evolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As previously mentioned, most fossils are found in sedimentary rock formations.&amp;nbsp; In general, deeper sedimentary rock layers formed earlier than more shallow layers.&amp;nbsp; Thus, the fossils found in deeper layers are older than fossils found in more shallow layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This understanding allows us to assign relative ages to fossils.&amp;nbsp; In other words, this fossil is older than that fossil, but does not allow an absolute date to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolute dating methods allow biologists to determine a more precise age of a fossil.&amp;nbsp; Examples of absolute dating methods are radiometric dating, dendrochronology, and amino acid racemization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;Radiometric dating involves looking at the radioactive decay rates of elements such as Carbon-14 and Radium-226.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these radioactive isotopes decays at a constant rate and radioactive decay is measured in half-lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A half-life is the amount of time it takes for half of a radioactive element to decay into a daughter product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;Radiocarbon dating is a common radiodating technique with good reliability.&amp;nbsp; The half-life of Carbon-14 is approximately 5700 years so this technique can only be used to date objects that are approximately 50,000 years old or less.&amp;nbsp; Objects that are older than 50,000 years have too little Carbon-14 to measure reliably. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;Let's see a simple example of how radioactive decay can be used to calculate ages of objects.&amp;nbsp; The half-life of radium-226 is 1620 years.&amp;nbsp; Remember, this means that it takes 1620 years for half of the initial amount of radium-226 to decay to a daughter element.&amp;nbsp; If a sample contains 16 mg of radium-226, how much will it contain in 3240 years?&amp;nbsp; Also, how long will it take to contain 1 mg?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;The answer to the first question is 4 mg.&amp;nbsp; Remember that the half-life of radium-226 is 1620 years - so 3240 years is the same as two half-lives.&amp;nbsp; After one half-life the sample will contain 8 mg of radium-226 (half of 16 mg is 8 mg) and after a second half-life the sample will contain 4 mg of radium-226.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to the second question is 6480 years or four half-lives.&amp;nbsp; The original sample had 16 mg of radium-226.&amp;nbsp; After one half-life there is 8 mg, after 2 half-lives there will be 4 mg, after 3 half-lives there will be 2 mg, and after 4 half-lives there will be 1 mg.&amp;nbsp; Each half-life reduces the amount of the radioactive isotope by half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;Dendrochronology is the scientific method of dating based on the analysis of patterns of tree-rings. Dendrochronology can date the time at which tree rings were formed to the exact calendar year.Many trees in temperate zones make one growth ring each year, with the newest adjacent to the bark. For the entire period of a tree's life, a year-by-year record is formed that reflects the climatic conditions in which the tree grew. Adequate moisture and a long growing season result in a wide ring. A drought year may result in a very narrow one as can be seen in this image on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7&lt;br&gt;Dendrochronology is generally used to date specimens that are relatively young.&amp;nbsp; In some uses, it can be used to date specimens that are 5,000 years or younger.&amp;nbsp; More typically, it is limited to dating specimens that are hundreds of years old.&amp;nbsp; This limitation is due, in part, to the fact that our old growth forests are endangered and many of the oldest trees have been forested to supply wood for wood products and are no longer available for scientific analysis. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 8&lt;br&gt;Another example of an absolute dating technique is amino acid racemization.&amp;nbsp; Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins (we will learn more about them in future lessons).&amp;nbsp; Outside of living organisms they occur in two mirror image forms - the L and the D form.&amp;nbsp; In living organisms, only the L form exists.&amp;nbsp; After an organism dies, the L-form amino acids change to D-form.&amp;nbsp; This is the process of racemization.&amp;nbsp; The amount of L- versus D-forms in a remain can give information about its age.&amp;nbsp; It is a useful technique because it can be used to date remains as old as 200,000 years.&amp;nbsp; However, it has some important limitations because racemization rates are affected by temperature, humidity, salinity, and pH.&amp;nbsp; So if the conditions in an area are not constant, racemization rates are not constant.&amp;nbsp; This is in contrast to radiometric dating because radioactive decay rates are always contant - decay rates are not affected by environmental factors so radiometric decay provides a more accurate measure of a remains' age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 9&lt;br&gt;So let's try another practice problem.&amp;nbsp; Attempt this problem on your own and then view the next VoiceThread lecture to see the problem solved.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;Let's see how you did answering this practice problem. This question asks you to calculate the age of a sample that has 25% of the original amount of C-14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;The answer is D - 11,460 years old.&amp;nbsp; So, why is this the correct answer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;Organisms accumulate C-14 throughout their lives.&amp;nbsp; At the time of death, an organism has a certain amount of C-14.&amp;nbsp; After death, the C-14 begins to decay into N-14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we can consider the time of death to be time 0.&amp;nbsp; At t=0, the organism has 100% of its C-14 content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After each half-life, the organism loses 50% of its C-14 to radioactive decay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;In other words, we can consider time 0 as 100% of the C-14 content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At time 1 (one half-life), the amount of C-14 is 50% of the original amount.&amp;nbsp; Remember, one half-life loses half of the original C-14 to radioactive decay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At time 2 (two half-lives), the amount of C-14 is 25% of the original. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The half-life of C-14 is 5730 years, so if a sample has 25% of its original C-14 it can be calculated to be 11,460 years old (this is calculated by multiplying 5730 years x 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actual radiometric dating calculations are more complicated but follow this same basic idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have questions about how to solve problems like this one, please contact either me or a teaching assistant.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Prokaryotes I Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;Prokaryotes are organisms that lack a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles.&amp;nbsp; Organisms with a nucleus are referred to as eukaryotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are a diverse group of organisms that are structurally rather simple but have a wide array of metabolic modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three basic shapes - cocci which are spherical, bacilli which are rod shaped, and spirilla which have a spiral morphology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to eukarytoes, the prokaryotes have a small amount of DNA.&amp;nbsp; The smallest known bacteria, the Mycoplasmas, have only about 500 genes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The largest bacteria have about 5000 genes.&amp;nbsp; The simplest eukaryotic genomes have about 5000 genes and the largest eukaryote genome belongs to Trichomonas vaginalis - a single celled organism that causes urinary tract infections.&amp;nbsp; It has 60,000 genes while humans have only 20,000 genes.&amp;nbsp; It has been a paradox to biologists why the number of genes is not related to organismal complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;The prokaryotes are divided into two main groups - the bacteria and the archaea.&amp;nbsp; Domain bacteria contains prokaryotes whose cell walls contain a unique substance known as peptidoglycan.&amp;nbsp; Peptidoglycan is a polymer of sugars and proteins that plays a structural role in bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another distinguishing characteristic of the bacteria is that their genes lack introns.&amp;nbsp; Introns are non-coding regions of genes.&amp;nbsp; In both eukaryotes and archaea - genes have intervening sequences that are not transcribed or translated into protein.&amp;nbsp; The bacteria do not possess these introns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;Domain Archaea is comprised of individuals that are characterized by lacking peptidoglycan, producing unique cell membrane lipds, and possessing introns in some of their genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Archaea used to be considered extremophiles - organisms that can live in extreme environments like the&amp;nbsp; highly saline environment of these San Francisco bay salt ponds, the extremely hot environment of this Yellowstone National Park hot spring, and the high sulfur high temperature environment at the bottom of the ocean near this ocean vent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we now know that there are Archaea in non-extreme environments like soil and water.&amp;nbsp; Some even inhabit the human gut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;Originally, the prokaryotic organisms were all grouped together into a single kingdom - the Monera.&amp;nbsp; You may have learned this classification system in a previous biology course.&amp;nbsp; Life used to be classified using a 5 kingdom system - the plants, animals, fungi, single-celled protists, and the monera - which included all of the bacteria and archaea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now recognize that this system does not adequately reflect evolutionary relatedness between these groups.&amp;nbsp; We now use a 3 domain system of classification.&amp;nbsp; This system recognizes that all eukaryotic organisms are descended from a common ancestor.&amp;nbsp; It also recognizes that the bacteria and the archaea are not closely related and share only superficial similarities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;The 3 domain system recognizes that the archaea and the eukaryotes are more closely related to each other than either is to the bacteria. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We read evolutionary trees like these by noting the distance between branches.&amp;nbsp; The closer a branching point - the closer the evolutionary relatedness.&amp;nbsp; These trees reflect our current understanding that the prokaryotes are diverse and the bacteria and archaea are not closely related.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Prokaryotes II Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;Within Domain Bacteria, there are two basic types of organisms.&amp;nbsp; Bacteria can be either gram + or gram -.&amp;nbsp; Gram + bacteria are bacteria that absorb a stain known as a gram stain.&amp;nbsp; The gram + bacteria have a relatively thick layer of peptidoglycan (the peptidoglycan is shown in blue) and they do not have an outer membrane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gram - bacteria have a relatively thin layer of peptidoglycan and they have a complex outer membrane.&amp;nbsp; They are called gram - because they do not absorb the gram stain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;When you are feeling ill and go to the doctor - she may suspect a bacterial infection and perform a bacterial culture.&amp;nbsp; If you have a sore throat for example, she will swab your throat with a cotton swab and grow the bacteria on a petri dish.&amp;nbsp; She will then stain the bacteria to determine if they are gram + or gram - because this distinction will help her determine a course of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of gram + infections are strep throat, some types of food poisoning, tetanus, and anthrax.&amp;nbsp; As you can see from this picture - the gram + bacteria stain a dark purple from the gram strain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;Gram - organisms do not take up the gram stain and instead of being dark purple are pink.&amp;nbsp; E. coli is an example of a gram negative bacterium. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infections due to gram - bacteria can be difficult to treat because the complex structure of their outer membrane can evade antibiotics and even contain endotoxins that can cause disease.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;Prokaryotes are capable of movement in their environment and even though they do not have a brain, they can orient themselves in their environments and move toward or away from environmental stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way in which bacteria can move is by exceting a slime layer that they can then use to glide across a surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large numbers of bacteria can cooperate with each other and secrete a slime layer known as a biofilm.&amp;nbsp; When you wake up in the morning your teeth probably feel a bit slimy.&amp;nbsp; This is the biofilm that the bacteria in your mouth have produced over night.&amp;nbsp; We brush our teeth to help break up and wash away this biofilm to avoid cavities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some bacteria have flagella which are hair-like structures that they can move like a whip to propel themselves through their environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This movement is usually in response to an environmental stimulus - for example, some bacteria can respond to light - this is known as phototaxis.&amp;nbsp; Bacteria can respond to gravity (geotaxis) and chemicals in the environment (chemotaxis).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;Biofilms are common in nature, as bacteria commonly have mechanisms by which they can adhere to surfaces and to each other. As mentioned earlier, dental plaque is a biofilm. In industrial environments, biofilms can develop on the interiors of pipes and lead to clogs and corrosion. In medicine, biofilms spreading along implanted tubes or wires can lead to serious infections in patients. Biofilms on floors and counters can make sanitation difficult in food preparation areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biofilms can also be harnessed for constructive purposes. For example, many sewage treatment plants include a treatment stage in which waste water passes over biofilms grown on filters, which extract and digest harmful organic compounds.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;While prokaryotes are structurally more simple than eukaryotes - metabolically they are more diverse and capable of a much wider array of metabolic modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four basic metabolic modes - photoautotrophy, chemoautotrophy, photoheterotrophy, and chemoheterotrophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;Eukaryotic organisms are only capable of two of these metabolic modes - photoautrophy as we see in the form of photosynthesis in the plants and chemoheterotrophy as we see in animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;Metabolic modes are based on where an organism gets its energy and where it gets its carbon.&amp;nbsp; Energy can either come from sunlight or energy-rich molecules.&amp;nbsp; Carbon can either come from carbon dioxide or organic molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plants use sunlight for energy and carbon dioxide for carbon and are classified as photoautotrophs.&amp;nbsp; Animals use organic molecules as both a carbon source and an energy source and are classified as chemoheterotrophs. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacteria can use photoautotrophy and chemoheterotrophy but they can also be photoheterotrophs and chemoautotrophs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;These diverse metabolic modes allow prokaryotes to live in diverse environments that in general do not support eukaryotic life such as hot springs, hydrothermal vents, and salt ponds.&amp;nbsp; There are even bacteria that can survive inside nuclear reactors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;Symbiotic relationships refer to long term associations between two different species.&amp;nbsp; We classify symbiotic relationships according to how the two species are affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mutualism is relationship in which both species benefit (we indicate this with a +,+).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A commensalism is a relationsip in which one species benefits and the other species is relatively unaffected (indicated with a + and 0).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parasitism is a relationship in which the parasite benefits and the host organism is harmed (indicated with a + and -).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example of mutualism we can look at the pea aphid and its bacterial endosymbiont.&amp;nbsp; An endosymbiont is an organism that lives inside its symbiotic partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, is an insect pest that sucks the juices from its host plant. However, plant sap is deficient in several essential amino acids.&lt;br&gt;The pea aphid thrives nonetheless thanks to specialized cells within its body that contain the gamma proteobacterium, Buchnera aphidicola, that can live nowhere else.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The genome of this endosymbiotic Gram-negative bacterium encodes a number of enzymes needed to complete the synthesis of the amino acids needed by its host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In return, the aphid's genome encodes enzymes needed by Buchnera to synthesize its lipopolysaccharide cell wall and has lost genes that might otherwise repel infection by Gram-negative bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;As an example of commensalism we can think about all of the different bacteria that live in us and on us.&amp;nbsp; Some of these are mutualists that help us synthesize vitamins and avoid infection by nasty bacteria.&amp;nbsp; Some are these nasty parasite bacteria that can make us sick.&amp;nbsp; But many are commensalistic - at least as far as we know.&amp;nbsp; They live in us and on us and we are relatively unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the human intestine has an insane number of bacteria - somewhere in the number of 100 trillion.&amp;nbsp; Some biologists have suggested that the human intestine has the highest cell density on earth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to remember that symbiotic relationships can change when the environment changes.&amp;nbsp; For example, it is very dangerous to experience a stomach wound - all of these bacteria that live in our intestines and cause no problems - can become quite dangerous if the stomach wall is breached and the bacteria get into our blood stream. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;A dramatic example of parasitism is the gram negative bacterium Yersinia pestis - which is responsible for the disease known as the plague or the black death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This disease is spread by fleas or through direct contact with a sick person. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fleas are common inhabitants of the fur of rats so outbreaks of the plague have been correlated with peaks in rat populations.&amp;nbsp; In the 6th century the plague ravaged the world for about 50 years and caused 100 million deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This nasty disease visited Europe again in the 14th century and killed 25 million people which was about 25% of the total European population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;Today we can treat Yersinia pestis with antibiotics but it still exists and makes people sick - even in the US where there are about 10 cases per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;Discussions about bacteria in the popular press are usually focused on the bad things that bacteria do like make us sick. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, most bacteria either do not affect us directly or are beneficial.&amp;nbsp; We rely on bacteria to help us synthesize vitamins, maintain a healthy digestive tract, and develop our immune systems.&amp;nbsp; Bacteria play an essential role as recyclers of organic material in the environment and help keep soils fertile so plants can continue to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have also learned to use bacteria in beneficial ways - we now use bacteria to make human medicines - for example, we use bacteria to make insulin for the treatment of people with diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have learned to use bacteria to help us clean our environment - bioremediation is the process of using biological organisms like bacteria to clean up the environment.&amp;nbsp; We can use bacteria to eat oil spills and chemical spills - this is, of course, due to the fact that prokaryotes have such diverse metabolic modes.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Prokaryotes III Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;Recall that most of the bacteria that exist on earth either go unnoticed by us or are beneficial.&amp;nbsp; In this tutorial, we are discussing examples of bacteria that are beneficial - not only for us but for all life on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;Nitrogen is an essential element for all living things.&amp;nbsp; Recall the structure of the macromolecules - nitrogen is found in the amino acids and nucleic acids and in many vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While nitrogen is an abundant element on earth - it is found mainly as nitrogen gas which is not a biologically useful form on the element.&amp;nbsp; The only organisms on earth that can use nitrogen gas are the nitrogen fixing bacteria.&amp;nbsp; Nitrogen fixation is the process of converting nitrogen gas into ammonia.&amp;nbsp; This ammonia is then converted by other organisms into other nitrogen containing compounds that can travel through the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;This movement of nitrogen-containing compounds through the environment is known as the nitrogen cycle.&amp;nbsp; You do not need to know the details of the nitrogen cycle but you do need to recognize that if it were not for the nitrogen-fixing bacteria - none of these nitrogen containing compounds would be available for other organisms.&amp;nbsp; Nitrogen-fixing bacteria make life on earth possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;The nitrogen-fixing bacteria live in association with the roots of certain plants.&amp;nbsp; Here, for example, we see the root system of a soybean plant.&amp;nbsp; The small nodules on the roots house the nitrogen-fixing bacteria. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plants in the legume family (which includes plants like peas, alfalfa, clover, and peanuts) are common partners with these nitrogen-fixing bacteria.&amp;nbsp; This relationship is a mutualism - the bacteria get a place to live and a supply of sugars from the plants and the plants get a supply of nitrogen which is essential for plant growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;Traditional farming methods involved planting legumes to help maintain soil fertility.&amp;nbsp; Fertile soils have a relatively high nitrogen content - this nitrogen is consumed by plants and when we harvest the plants we remove the nitrogen from the soil.&amp;nbsp; Legumes can help return this nitrogen to the soil.&amp;nbsp; Here we see a planting of coffee shrubs grown interspersed with a leguminous tree.&amp;nbsp; The tree provides nitrogen to the soil and this reduces the need for synthetic fertilizers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;Prokaryotes are also responsible for the oxygen we breathe.&amp;nbsp; Earth's early atmosphere was anaerobic and the first organisms were chemoautotrophs that used the high energy chemical compounds that were abundant on earth at the time.&amp;nbsp; As the bacterial population increased, the competition for these high energy compounds increased and the supply of these nutrients ran low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This resulted in the evolution of photosynthesis - using sunlight for energy rather than chemicals.&amp;nbsp; We will talk about photosynthesis in more detail later in the course but for now you need to recognize that oxygen gas is a by-product of photosynthesis.&amp;nbsp; As the population of photosynthetic bacteria grew - the amount of oxygen in the environment increased and the atmosphere became aerobic. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For earth's earliest inhabitants the appearance of oxygen was toxic. Recall that oxygen is highly electronegative - it attracts electrons.&amp;nbsp; This electronegativity can damage cell membranes, proteins, and DNA by pulling electrons away and creating nasty compounds known as free radicals.&amp;nbsp; Free radicals can cause even further damage to cell structures. Organisms that had evolved in an oxygen free environment had little ability to protect themselves from the damaging effects of oxygen. This dramatic change in the environment caused mass extinctions and marked a major change in the evolution of life on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7&lt;br&gt;We can classify organisms based on their tolerance or need for oxygen.&amp;nbsp; Obligate aerobes are organisms that require oxygen for life - we are obligate aerobes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obligate anaerobes are organisms that have no need for oxygen and may be poisoned by it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facultative anaerobes have the best of both worlds - they can use oxygen if it is present but they don't need it.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Animals III Part 3 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Animals III Part 3 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1 Subphylum Vertebrata includes all of the animals that we refer to as the vertebrates. The animals in this subphylum have pronounced cephalization, a vertebral column (also known as an axial endoskeleton), and a hard cranium that protects the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2 Subphylum Vertebrata includes the fishes - the jawless fishes, the sharks and rays, and the bony fishes. It also include the amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Similar to the evolution of the plants - the story of vertebrate evolution is a story of increasing independence from water. The fishes are obviously all aquatic - the amphibians are more independent of water but still require a moist environment. The reptiles, birds, and mammals are charactertized by much reduced dependence on water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3 The fishes include the jawless fishes - so called because they do not have a jaw and instead of sucker-like mouthparts. The Condrichthyes are also known as the cartilagenous fishes - their skeleton is made of cartilage. This group includes the sharks, skates, and rays. The Osteichthyes are also known as the bony fishes because their skeleton is made of bone. This is the largest most successful group of fishes and includes most of the freshwater fishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4 The jawless fishes are also known as the agnathans. They do not have jaws and instead of sucking and rasping mouthparts that many of them use to parasitize other fish. Sea lamprey for example use their sucking mouthparts to attach to lake trout and can ultimately kill the trout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5 The other two groups of fish have jaws and paired fins. The fins help them to swim and steer more effectively while the jaws help them to grasp prey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6 The Condricthyes includes the skates and rays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7 And the Osteicthyes includes a huge array of fish with different body plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 8 The amphibians evolved from a fleshy finned fish such as a lungfish or a coelacanth. The amphibians are the first land vertebrates but they are not completely independent of water. Just as plants had to overcome the obstacles of land - so did the animals. Land animals had to adjust their locomotion - this was accomplished by the development of four limbs (the land vertebrates are also called the tetrapods). Gills had to give way to lungs and skin for respiration. Most amphibians live in moist areas to prevent desiccation while reproduction became internal for many tetrapods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 9 The amphibians inlcude frogs, toads, and salamanders. You can see the moist skin of the amphibians - they are not completely independent of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 10 The reptiles, birds and mammals are referred to as the amniotes. This is because all 3 groups reproduce via an amniotic egg. The amniotic egg provides protection to the developing embryo from drying out and also provides a nutrient supply. In this way the amniotic egg is similar to the seed of the seed plants - it allows an increased independence from water. The amniotes also have skaly skin which provides further protection from desiccation for the adult animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 11 This image shows the amniotic egg in both a bird and a human. Bird eggs do most of their development outside the mother's body while the human egg develops internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 12 Reptiles include lizards, snakes, alligators and turtles. Some reptiles have returned to the water and live an aquatic life. They retain terrestrial characteristics such as lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 13 Birds arose from the dinosaurs and are characterized by feathers made of keratin and flight. Feathers most likely evolved for insulation and then secondarily became important for flight. Flight requires a light body plan - and birds have evolved to have a very light body. Birds' bones are hollow to lighten the skeleton and many of the birds organs have been reduced to reduce weight. For example, most tetrapods have two ovaries but birds only have one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 14 Once birds evolved, diversification took place rapidly and we see a great diversity in the birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 15 Our last group of vertebrates are the mammals. Mammals evolved from a reptilian ancestor and are characterized by a modified skeleton - particularly the structure of the lower jaw and the inner ear. Mammals have fur (another modification of keratin) and fur provides insulation for endothermic or warm-blooded animals. Mammals are also characterized by the presence of some sort of mammary gland which produces milk for offspring. The mammals contribute a lot of energy to parental care of young. Most mammals have live young but there is one group - the monotremes - that lay eggs. The marsupials are those mammals that give birth to undeveloped young and then raise these young in a pouch. The eutherians or placental mammals are the most successful and they give birth to more well-developed offspring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 16 The monotremes are now restricted to Australia and New Guinea but were once more abundant. They are egg laying mammals and include the duck-billed platapus and the spiny echidnas. Slide 17 The marsupials are the pouched mammals like kangaroos and koalas. They are found mainly in Australia but we have one prominent marsupial in the Americas - the opposum. Slide 18 The Eutherian or Placental mammals are the most successful group of mammals and are found world-wide. Placental mammals, which includes ourselves, give birth to well-developed offspring and invest a large amount of energy in parental care.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;p&gt;Slide 1 We have arrived at our last group of animals - the chordates. The chordates fall within the deuterostomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2 The characteristics of Phylum Chordata are a hollow, dorsal nerve cord, a notochord, pharyngeal gill slits, and a post anal tail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3 This diagram shows the characteristics of the chordates - all chordates have these characteristics at some point in their development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4 There are three subphyla within the chordates - the Urochordata, the Cephalochordata, and the group that we are in - the Vertebrata. Slide 5 The Urochordates are commonly referred to as the Tunicates or Seasquirts. The larvae of this group have all of the 4 chordate characteristics. The adults lose the notochord, nerve cord, and post-anal tail but retain the pharyngeal gill slits. The adults are sessile organisms that live in the shallow regions oceans attached to rocks and other stationary structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6 This image shows both adult and larval individuals- the larvae have all 4 chordate characteristics while the adults only have pharyngeal gill slits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7 Subphylum Cephalochordata are commonly referred to as lancelets or amphioxus. They are another marine group and the adults have all 4 chordate characteristics. These organisms bury themselves in the sediment in shallow sandy beach regions and filter feed the food particles that float by. They only emerge to reproduce and they lead a very exciting life.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Animals III Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1 Our first group of deuterostome animals are the echinoderms - represented by the sea stars and sea urchins. It may seem odd - but this group of organisms is most closely related to us than any group we have discussed thus far. We recognize the close evolutionary relatedness because we share a deuterstome mode of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2 Phylum echinodermata consists of the sea stars, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, brittle stars, and feather stars. Notice that as adults these organisms have a radial symmetry - but they are members of the bilateria. While they are radial as adults - they are bilateral as larvae. This group of organisms has an endoskeleton and a unique mode of motility involving a water vascular system and tube feet. The water vascular system is a system of canals filled with fluid that connect to the tube feet. The tube feet use hydraulic pressue to expand and contract and move the animal along the sea floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3 This is an exclusively marine group - so while they have evolutionary advanced characters they are still dependent on an aquatic environment.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;p&gt;Slide 1 Our last group of protostome animals are the arthropods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2 This is diverse group of organisms with over 1 million described species and potentially 10 million more yet to be described. Two out of three known animal species are arthropods and most of the unknown species will be found in tropical rainforests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3 The diversity and success of the arthropods are attributed to three main features of the arthropods. A segmented body (notice that the segmentation of the arthropods is much more advanced than the segmentation seen in the annelids). Jointed appendages allow for greater mobility and more advanced behaviors and a hard exoskeleton made of chitin that provides physical support, protection from trauma, and prevention of dessication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4 The body segments in the arthropods occur in three distinct segments - a head, thorax, and abdomen. This segmentation allows for greater body and metabolic specialization. Different parts of the body can move and function independently of each other and this provides great advantages to the arthropods and other organisms with advanced body segmentation. In some arthropods, such as this spider, the head and thorax are fused together into a structure known as a cephalothorax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5 This diagram of a lobster clearly shows the segments of this arthropod. Lobsters have a cephalothorax with a fused head and thorax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6 Jointed appendages are another feature of the arthropods that have contributed to their success. These jointed appendages have contributed to greater mobility (imagine trying to run without knees). The appendages have been modified in different species for sensing the environment, feeding, and locomotion. These appendages can also be highly modified for defense, mate attraction, and predation. As an example - we can compare the front appendages of the striped mantis shrimp and the peacock mantis shrimp. The striped mantis shrimp feeds on fish and use the speark like projections on its appendage to spear fish as they swim by. The peacock mantis shrimp, on the other hand, feeds on animals inside shells. The club-like appendage of the peacock mantis can generate incredible crushing force - measured as high as 340 pounds of force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7 The hard chitinous cuticle of the arthropods protects the animals from physical injury, provides physical support and a structure for muscle attachment, as well as preventing desiccation. Because the skeleton is on the outside - as the animal grows it must shed its cuticle during an event known as molting. This is a very sensitive time in the life cycle because it takes some time for a new cuticle to replace the one lost through molting. Softshell crab season takes advantage of this molt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 8 There are four subphyla of arthropods. The first are the trilobites which are all extinct. This fossil shows the distinct segmentation of this animal but the segments are not specialized the way they are in most modern day arthropods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 9 The chelicerates is comprised of spiders, scorpions, ticks, and mites. They are characterized by having a cephalothorax and an abdomen with 4 pairs of walking legs, one pair of chelicerae, and one pair of pedipalps This is a mainly terrestrial group with the exception of the horseshoe crabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 10 Horseshoe crabs are commonly referred to as living fossils - they evolved 450 million years ago and have changed little in that time. You can see in this image that modern day horseshoe crabs look pretty much the same as the fossilized horeshoe crab from hundreds of millions of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 11 The crustaceans include crabs, lobsters, crayfish, shrimp, pill bugs, and wood lice. This is a mainly aquatic group - with the exception of the pill bugs and wood lice. Some species are semi-aquatic like hermit crabs and fiddler crabs which live on the shore near the water. These organisms have jaw-like mandibles, compound eyes, two pair of antennae and branched appendages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 12 The uniramians are the largest group of arthropods and include the insects, centipedes, and millipedes. They have jaw-like mandibles and compound eyes like the crustaceans but they have only one pair of antennae and unbranched appendages. This is a mainly terrestrial group - in general, the uniramians are most abundant on land and the crustaceans are most abundant in the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 13 The insects are the most species rich group of organisms on earth. It is estimated that there are 10 million species of insects on earth today. They are a mainly terrestrial group but there are a few freshwater species. This group includes the only invertebrate organisms that have the ability to fly. Within the insects - the beetles are the most abundant. In fact, British geneticist J.B.S. Haldane is credited with saying nature has shown an "inordinate fondness for beetles".&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;p&gt;Slide 1 Our next group of protostome animals are the annelids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2 Phylum Annelida consists of earthworms, leeches, and marine polychaete worms. These protostome coelomates are the first group to exhibit body segmentation. These organisms live in both terrestrial and aquatic environments and they are both free living and parasitic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3 Segmentation is not well-developed in the annelids but is does provide benefits to these organisms. Segmentation of the body allows for specialization of discrete parts of the body. It also allows for more advanced mobility because a segmented organism can move parts of its body independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4 Some of the annelids can get quite large - like this giant earthworms found in places like ecuador and australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5 The marine polychaete worms are an aquatic group of often beautiful feathery worms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6 Earthworms play an important role in developing high quality soils. When they burrow through soils they help to aerate soil and when they digest food and excrete waste this adds nutrients to the soil. In a square meter of soil there may be as many as 32,000 worms that may ingest and excrete 3 metric tons of soil per year.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;p&gt;Slide 1 The next group of organisms we will look at are members of the protostomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2 Remember that the protostome animals are those animals that show spiral cleavage and determinate cells at the 8-cell stage of development. Later in development, the mouth develops from the blastopore and the anus develops secondarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3 The first group of protostomes we will look at is Phylum Mollusca which includes clams, snails, octopuses and sea slugs. This group is characterized by soft unsegmented bodies and often a shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4 In the mollusks we see a much more complicated body plan than any of the other organisms we have looked at thus far. The basic mollusk body plan consists of a muscular foot, a visceral mass, and a mantle. This drawing depicts the basic anatomy of a mollusk. The foot is used for movement (especially in the gastropods) or as an anchor (as observed in chitons). The visceral mass houses most of the internal organs (e.g., the stomach, gonads, and heart). The mantle is the tissue layer that covers the visceral mass. In organisms that have shells, the mantle produces the shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5 There are four main groups of mollusks. The gastropods include snails, slugs and nudibranchs. This group has both terrestrial and aquatic representatives but the nudibranchs are only aquatic. They often have beautiful colors to advertise that they are highly toxic and should not be eaten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6 The bivalves includes mussels, oysters, and clams. They are an aquatic group characterized by two hinged shells. Some of them like the zebra mussel are invasive species that are causing problems in the great lakes. Others like this gooeyduck clam and oyster are prized edibles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7 The cephalapods include the octopuses, squid, cuttlefish, and nautiluses. They all have a head surrounded by tentacles that they use for locomotion and grasping prey. The cephalopods have well developed nervous systems - they have excellent vision and are highly intelligent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 8 Cephalopods have highly advanced behaviors - such as mimicry and mating behavior. This octupus is mimicing a starfish to avoid predation and these squid are involved in an elaborate courtship. No other organisms we have looked at thus far have had these abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 9 Chitons are obscure mollusks that cling to rocks in shallow ocean waters.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;p&gt;Slide 1 The next group of bilateria are the pseudocoelomates. Our representative group will be the nematodes (notice that we will not discuss the rotifers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2 The pseudocoelomates are those animals with a body cavity that is surrounded by both endoderm and mesoderm (as opposed to the true coelomates that have a body cavity completely surrounded by medoderm).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3 Phylum Nematoda is a diverse group of worm-like organisms that live in just about every environment on earth. They are much more independent of water than the acoelomate flatworms. They are able to move through their environment through the use of a hydrostatic skeleton - a fluid filled space that provides structural support to the animal. This is also the first animal we are looking at that has a complete digestive tract. This means that there are two openings - both a mouth and an anus. There are both free living and parasitic species. Many of them are beneficial soil species that improve soil fertility and aid plant growth. Other species are nasty parasites that cause disease in a wide variety of organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4 A hydrostatic skeleton is the skeletal system that is used by the majority of invertebrate animals for movement and support. A hydrostatic skeleton is one that contains no rigid, hard structures or bones for support but rather rely on a fluid-filled cavity usually surrounded by muscles. Hydrostatic skeletons are found in molluscs like this snail, the cnidarians, the nematodes, and other soft-bodied animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5 In the nematodes we see a complete digestive tract - this is not found in the cnidarians or the flatworms - these organisms have an incomplete digestive tract. A complete digestive tract is one in which food is ingested at one end of the tract, the mouth, and wastes from digestion are passed out of the tract at the other end, the anus. A complete digestive tract is an evolutionary advance - it allows for specialization along the length of the tract. For example, different digestive enzymes can be used along different parts of the tract for more efficient digestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6 Phylum Nematoda is an incredibly abundant group of organisms. There are about 200,000 described species and there are most likely many more undescribed species. They are second only to the insects in number of species. These are the most abundant animal in terms of number of individuals making up about 80-90% of all animals. For example, if you were to dig up a cubic foot of soil - about the amount that would fit in a shoe box - there will be about 1.5 million nematodes in the soil. They include beneficial soil organisms that digest organic matter and return nutrients to the soil. They also include some serious parasites such as trichinosis that come from eating undercooked pork, and elephantiasis which is an enlargement of the lower extremeties as a result of blockage of the lymph system. They can also cause serious damage to crop plants.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;p&gt;Slide 1 Our representative group of radially symmetrical diploblasts are the Cnidarians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2 This group is characterized by radial symmetry and they are diploblastic - they have 2 embryonic tissue layers - endoderm and ectoderm. They do not have mesoderm so they do not have true muscles - this means that they are limited in their mobility and some of them are sessile (non-moving) as adults. This is another completely aquatic group - they live mainly in marine environments but there are some freshwater cnidarians. Phylum Cnidaria consists of jellyfish, corals, and sea anemones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3 The Cnidarians exist in either a poly or medusa form. The polyp form is sessile and the medusa form is motile. Most cnidarians have specialized cells known as cnidocytes that they use to sting either potential predators or prey. Within the cnidocytes are small stinging organelles known as nemetocysts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4 This image shows the structure of the cnidocytes and nematocysts. The cnidocytes have a trigger - when something brushes against a trigger it causes a nematocyst to discharge and sting the offending organism. If you have ever been stung by a jellyfish - it was because you brushed against these triggers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5 The cnidarians are capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction is the result of budding off of polyps from a parent individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6 There are three classes within Phylum Cnidaria. Class Hydrozoa consists of freshwater jellies, freshwater hydras, and the highly toxic Portuguese Man O' War. Organisms in this class can be either in the polyp or medusa stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7 Class Scyphozoa are the true jellyfish. They only occur in the medusa stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 8 Class Anthozoa consists of the sea anemones and corals. They occur only as polyps.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;p&gt;Slide 1 The first group of organisms we will look at are the sponges in phylum Porifera. They are the representative group of parazoans. The sponges do not have true tissues and do not have symmetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2 The term "Parazoa" literally translates as "beside the animals". This is the first group of animals to evolve and some biologists suggest the sponges should not be classified as animals at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3 The sponges have some characteristics of the animals - they have a motile stage and they are ingestive heterotrophs. However, they do not have true tissues or symmetry - all other animals do. Just like the plants and fungi, the animals evolved from an aquatic protist and the sponges are a completely aquatic group. Most of them live in marine environments but there are some freshwater sponges. Some biologists suggest that the sponges are not truly multicellular but rather a colony of interdependent cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4 One reason that some biologists think they are colonial is because they have such minimal cellular differentiation. There are distinct cell types but they do not function together as tissues and behave in many ways like individual cells living colonially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5 The sponges are widespread in marine environments and can be quite beautiful. Many people use natural sea sponges for bathing, painting and other crafts.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Animals I Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1 We are now going to talk through the major evolutionary events in animal evolution. Please be aware that this tree of animal evolution does not include all animal groups - but instead shows the groups that demonstrate these major events in animal evolution. As we talk through the tree - we will see that there are major bifurcations or branching points. The first bifurcation in the tree of animal evolution is the division between those animals that do not have true tissues - known as the parazoa - and those animals that do have true tissues - the eumetazoa. The group of organisms that demonstrates no true tissues are the sponges. All other animals on the tree fall within the eumetazoa and have true tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2 Another aspect of animal morphology is symmetry. The parazoa - those animals that lack true tissues - also lack symmetry. All of the eumetazoa have either radial symmetry or bilateral symmetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3 Our second bifurcation in the tree of animal evolution is the division between those animals with radial symmetry and those with bilateral symmetry. The representative group of radially symmetrical organisms is the group that includes the jellyfish. All other animals are members of the Bilateria and have bilateral symmetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4 Other distinguishing characterstics of the animals include developmental events. Developmental biology is the study of irreversible events from zygote to death. This includes the control of cell growth, differentiation of cells into different types, and the processes that gives rise to tissues, organs and anatomy. Slide 5 For the purposes of this course, we will only be looking at the earliest stages of animal development. As we have already learned, fertilization of an egg by a sperm produces a diploid zygote. This zygote then divides via mitosis to produce the earliest cells in the embryo. These earliest mitotic cell divisions are known as cleavage. Cleavage results in different types of cells in different types of organisms. In some organisms, the cells that result from these early cleavages are determinate. In other organisms, including humans, the cells are indeterminate. This means they have a characteristic known as totipotency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6 When a cell is determinate it means that the fate of the cells are determined when the cell is formed. When a cell is indeterminate it means that the developmental fate of the cells in the developing embryo are not determined by the identity of the parent cell - they can differentiate into any cell type. This means that these cells are totipotent - the ability of a cell to divide and produce all the cell types in an organism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7 Totipotent cells are also known as stem cells. Stem cells are a controversial issue because embryonic stem cells require the destruction of an embryo. This diagram shows the basic steps in cultivating stem cells. First, a fertilized egg is produced using in vitro fertilization - this means artificially producing an embryo in a lab. The resulting zygote develops for about 6 days - at which time it has produced an inner stem cell mass of totipotent cells. These cells are then harvested and, because they are totipotent, can be coaxed to develop into different cell types that can potentially be used in human therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 8 There are some key stages in development that distinguish the different branches of animal evolution. The first distinct structure to form during development is an 8-cell mass of cells. This develops into a hollow mass of cells known as a blastula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 9 The blastula then develops into a structure known as a gastrula through a process known as gastrulation. Gastrulation is the movement of surface cells into the developing embryo and during this process cells begin to differentiate into different tissue types. This is the first appearance of tissues in the developing embryo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 10 During gastrulation, either two or three tissue layers can result. Organisms that only produce two embryonic tissue layers (endoderm and ectoderm) are known as being diploblastic. Organisms that produce three embryonic tissue layers (endoderm, ectoderm, and mesoderm) are known as being triplobastic. Endoderm ultimately will develop into digestive organs and the tissues that line internal organs. Mesoderm will develop into skeleton and muscles. Ectoderm will develop into skin and nervous tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 11 At this point we can look once again the second bifurcation in the tree of animal evolution. Not only does it divide the Radiata from the Bilateria - but it also divides the diplobasts from the triplobasts. All of the radially symmetrical organims are diplobastic and produce only two embryonic tissue layers. All of the bilaterally symmetrical organisms are triploblastic and produce three embryonic tissue layers during gastrulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 12 Another developmental difference between the branches within the bilateria is whether or not there is an internal fluid filled cavity known as a coelom. Animals within the Bilateria can be either acoelomates - animals that lack a body cavity, or Psuedocoelomates which are animals that have a body cavity that forms between endoderm and mesoderm. The true coelomates are animals that have a coelom that forms within the mesoderm tissue. The coelom is a body cavity - it is not the same as the digestive tract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 13 This image from the tutorial shows the differences between these three types of animals. In this image - endoderm is yellow, mesoderm is red, ectoderm is blue and the coelom is white. The acoelomates do not have a body cavity - they have a solid body. The true coelomates have a coelom that is completely surrounded by mesoderm. The pseudocoelomates have a body cavity that is surrounded by mesoderm on one side and endoderm on the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 14 This brings us to the 3rd and 4th bifurcations in the tree of animal evolution. The 3rd bifurcation is between the aceolomates and those animals with a body cavity. The 4th bifurcation is between the pseudocoelomate and the true coelomates. The acoelomates are represented by the flatworms while the pseudocoelomates are represented by the nematodes. All of the remaining animals are members of the true coelomates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 15 Within the true coelomates, there is a final division - the protostomes and the deuterostomes. This distinction results during gastrulation when the movement of cells forms a structure known as an archenteron which will become the gut. The protostomes are those animals in which the mouth forms first. These animals have spiral cleavage at the 8-cell stage and the cells are determinate at this stage. The deuterstomes are those animals in which the mouths forms secondarily. These animals have radial cleavage at the 8-cell stage and the cells are indeterminate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 16 The 5th bifurcation in the tree of animal evolution is the division between protostomes and deuterostomes. The protostomes are represented by the molluscs, annelids, and arthropods. The deuterostomes are represented by the echinoderms and the chordates. The remaining tutorials will look at all of these different groups of animals in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h2 id="page-title" property="oer:name"&gt;Animals I Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1 We now begin our discussion of Kingdom Animalia. The animal kingdom is very diverse and includes both organisms that are very familiar to most of us and some not so familiar organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2 Fossil evidence suggests that animals evolved about 700 million years ago. They most likely evolved from a colonial protist similar to present day choanoflagellates. Choanoflagellates are similar in morphology and composition to the choanocyte cells of sponges - the first group of animals to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3 Animals are all multicellular and many individuals in the kingdom are known for their advanced mobility - like this lynx and hare shown here. All animals are also ingestive heterotrophs (remember, this is in comparison to the fungi which are absorptive heterotrophs). The animals are also marked by having well-developed tissues and a nervous system. We will see that these last two characteristics do not apply to the sponges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4 Tissues are collections of cells that perform the same function. They are not unique to the animals but many animals have highly developed and highly specialized tissues. An example is muscle tissue. Muscles are contractile tissues comprised of cells that are specialized to produce a force that allows movement. Muscle tissues have allowed many animals to develop amazing mobility including running, jumping, swimming and flying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5 Nervous tissue is tissue that is specialized to coordinate the transfer of information from the environment to the organism and around the organism. Many animals have both a central nervous system (which is essentially a brain) and a peripheral nervous system which is comprised of sensory cells that send information to the brain. The nervous system is made up of specialized cells called neurons - these are cells that send signals. The functions of the nervous system are sensory input, integration of sensory information, control of muscles and glands, maintenance of homeostasis within an organism, and mental activity. Nervous tissue is unique to Kingdom Animalia and some animals have highly developed nervous systems.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;p&gt;Slide 1 This question asks you to understand the organization of the photosystems in the light-dependent reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2 The answer is A - the electron transport chain associated with photosystem I reduces NADP+ to NADPH. Slide 3 This image from the previous tutorial shows the arrangement of the photosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4 This question asks you to understand what will happen if a photosytem becomes inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5 The answer is A - ATP production will decrease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6 It is the electron transport chain between photosystems II and I that is responsible for producing ATP - if it becomes inefficient there will be less ATP produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7 This plant is completely white and has no chlorophyll - does it fix carbon dioxide?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 8 The asnwer is no - this plant cannot photosynthesize because it has no chlorophyll. It is a parasite on host plants - its roots grow into the roots of trees and take sugars from the trees. It cannot produce its own sugars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 9 This question asks you to think about a plant that has an inactive Rubisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 10 The asnwer is C - this plant will be unable to fix carbon dioxide. Rubisco is the enzyme that catalyzes the fixation of carbon dioxide to RuBP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 11 This question asks you to think about what would happen if NADPH was no longer able to become oxidized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 12 The answer is B. Remember that oxidation is a loss of electrons - this means that NADPH would be unable to donate electrons during the Calvin cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 13 Without the ability to receive electrons from NADPH - the reduction phase of the Calvin cycle could not occur. If you have any questions about these practice problems - please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;p&gt;Slide 1 Recall that in the light-dependent reactions the two photosystems harness the energy in sunlight to produce ATP and NADPH. This ATP and NADPH will be used in the Calvin cycle to build a sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2 Sometimes it is interesting to learn about how we know what we know about biology. We know about the Calvin cycle because of the work of scientist Melvin Calvin and his colleague Bensen. They essentially built an artificial chloroplast and then they radioactively labelled the carbon in the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3 Chromatography allows scientists to see the movement of the radioactively labelled carbon through the system. After 10 seconds only the first compounds in the cycle are labelled. After 10 minutes more compounds in the cycle are labelled. In this way, Calvin and Bensen were able to determine the order of the compounds in the Calvin cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4 What they worked out is known as the Calvin cycle - or the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis. The Calvin cycle is a complex biochemical pathway that reduces carbon dioxide to sugar. Notice that there are three phases to this cycle - carbon fixation, reduction, and RuBP regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5 The molecules circled in red are the molecules you need to know in this cycle. Carbon dioxide is the input to the cycle - it is brought into the cycle by being added to a 5-carbon compound called RuBP. This is known as fixation - the carbon dioxide gets fixed to an organic molecule. The enzyme that catalyzes this reaction is known as Rubisco. It is thought to be the most abundant protein on earth because there are so many photosynthetic organisms on earth. The resulting 6-carbon compound is highly unstable and immediately breaks down into two 3-carbon compounds. It is these 3-carbon compounds that are reduced to sugar. This reduction process requires both energy and electrons. The energy comes from the ATP that was produced during the light-dependent reactions and the electrons come from the NADPH that was produced during the light-dependent reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6 The sugar that is produced is known as G3P - it is a 3-carbon sugar that will be used to produce glucose and other organic molecules. The cycle requires a constant supply of RuBP so the next stage is RuBP regeneration. This stage also requires energy in the form of ATP that was produced during the light-dependent reactions. Once the RuBP has been regenerated the cycle can continue and carbon fixation can begin again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7 So, to review how to make a sugar. The first stage is fixation when CO2 is added to the 5-carbon compound (ribulose bisphosphate; RuBP) by the enzyme Rubisco. An unstable 6C molecule forms (momentarily) and that 6C molecule splits into 2, 3-carbon molecules. During the reduction phase the 3C molecule is phosphorylated by ATP and forms an activated molecule and the phosphorylated 3C molecule is reduced to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) by NAPDH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 8 The G3P has two possible fates: It can be used to produce various 6-carbon sugars such as glucose or It can be used to produce more RuBP during the regeneration phase so the Calvin cycle can continue to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 9 The light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle make life as we know it possible. The light-dependent reactions provide energy for the Calvin cycle and also release oxygen as a by-product. We have already discussed how this oxygen changed the world and created an aerobic environment on earth. The Calvin cycle builds the sugars that serve as the base of the food chain that supports larger organisms such as ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Energy IV Photosynthesis Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1 There are two Electron Transport Chains in many photosynthetic organisms Just as in the electron transport chain in the mitochondria, the electron transport chains in photosynthesis are a series of redox reactions. The free energy that is released during these redox reactions is used for two reasons: One electron transport chain moves protons (H+) across a membrane to generate ATP - this happens in the same way the generation of ATP in the ETC in respiration happens - using the enzyme ATP synthase and oxidative phosphorylation. The other electron transport chain reduces the high energy electron carrier NADP+ to NADPH. NADP+ is similar to the NAD+ used by cellular respiration - it is a high energy electron carrier molecule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2 This image is a represenation of the movement of electrons through the two electron transport chains and two photosystems associated with photosynthesis. Photosystem I is associated with the electron transport chain that reduces NADP+ to NADPH and Photosystem II is associated with the electron transport chain that generates ATP by building a voltage across a membrane. This movement of electrons is known as the Z-scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3 When a photon of light hits Photosystem II - electrons are pushed to a high energy state. They bounce around the photosystem until they are grabbed by an electronegative electron acceptor molecule. Then the electron moves through the electron transport chain and hydrogen ions are pumped across the membrane. Again, this is just like the electron transport chain in mitochondria - a voltage is produced and ATP synthase uses this voltage to generate ATP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4 Similarly - when a photon of light hits Photosytem I the electrons bounce around until they are grabbed by an electronegative electron acceptor molecule. These electrons then get passed down the electron transport chain. But they are not used to create a voltage or generate ATP - instead they are used to reduce the high energy electron carrier NADP+ to NADPH. Remember - building a sugar is going to require both energy and electrons. The energy comes from the ATP produced by Photosystem II and the electrons come from the NADPH produced by Photosystem I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5 Photosystem II reduces NADP+ to NADPH. This means the photosynthesizing cell needs a constant supply of electrons. Without electrons - the systems would stop functioning. So, where do these electrons come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6 The answer is water. Photosystem II is associated with an enzyme whose job is to split a molecule fo water. It is the splitting of water that supplies the electrons needed by photosynthesis. The splitting of water also releases oxygen. This is where the oxygen by-product of photosynthesis is produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7 This image allows us to compare respiration in the mitochondria with photosynthesis in the chloroplast. What is important to notice is that both organelles contain electron transport chains that move electrons from a high energy state to a low energy state. In respiration, the movement of electrons builds a voltage that the enzyme ATP synthase uses to generate ATP. The same thing happens in photosynthesis but there is an additional electron transport chain that does not create a voltage but instead reduces NADP+ to NADPH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 8 So, why do plants need water for photosynthesis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 9 The answer is that the water supplies electrons that will be used to reduce carbon dioxide to sugar in the Calvin cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 10 The sugar that is the ultimate goal of photosynthesis is not produced during the light-dependent reactions. The light-dependent reactions produce the ATP and NADPH that will be used in the Calvin cycle to build the sugar. We will learn about this in the next tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Energy IV Photosynthesis Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1 Photosynthesis is the process that photoautotrophic organisms use to build sugars using the energy from sunlight. There are many types of photosynthetic organisms - bacteria, archaea, protists, and plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2 So, what is photosynthesis? Photosynthesis is the reduction of carbon dioxide to sugar - using the energy of sunlight. The reduction of carbon dioxide requires an electron donor (remember, reduction is the gain of electrons - when something is reduced something else must be oxidized). The electron donor that is oxidized is water. Oxygen is a by-product of this process. Remember that this oxygen by-product is hugely important. When photosynthesis first evolved, it changed the earth's atmosphere from anaerobic to aerobic. Today photosynthesis continues to add the oxygen to the atmosphere that we then breathe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3 The process of photosynthesis occurs in two major stages - the light dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle. The light-dependent Reactions are so called because they rely on a direct input of sunlight. These reactions produce ATP and NADPH that will be used in the Calvin cycle. The Calvin Cycle does not rely on a direct input of sunlight ( and is sometimes called the Dark Reactions - this is not the best name because it implies that these reactions only occur at night - and that is not the case). These reactions use the ATP and NADPH produced during the light reaactions to reduce carbon dioxide to sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4 In this tutorial, we will learn about the reactions of the light-dependent reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5 In eukaryotic organisms, the reactions of photosynthesis take place inside the chloroplast. The chloroplast is structurally similar to the mitochondria in that it is a double-membrane bound organelle that will take advantage of a voltage to provide energy for building sugars. The chloroplast is green because it contains the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll. There are other photosynthetic pigments - but we are going to limit our discussion to chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is a green pigment. A pigment is a molecule that is capable of absorbing energy from sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6 The chlorophyll molecules are organized into systems known as photosystems that are embedded into membranes inside the chloroplast. These photosystems enable to transfer of energy from sunlight to chemical energy in the cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7 The energy that chlorophyll absorbs is energy in the blue-violet range of the spectrum and in the red range of the spectrum. Green light is reflected by chlorophyll and does not provide energy for photosynthesis. Light travels in discrete energy packets known as photons (energy depends upon wavelength - shorter wavelengths have higher energy photons and longer wavelengths have lower energy photons). It is these photons that provide the energy for photosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 8 When sunlight hits a leaf, the absorbed photons dislodge electrons from low energy orbitals and push them into high energy orbitals - the electrons are now at a higher energy state than they were and the energy from sunlight has been converted to chemical energy. This excited state is unstable and the electrons can then participate in redox reactions The high energy electrons are then transferred to primary electron acceptors in the photosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 9 The photosystems are organized so that high energy electrons bounce around the photosystem until they land on a chlorophyll molecule known as the reaction center. This reaction center sits next to an electron acceptor molecule at the beginning of an electron transport chain. We will learn about these electron transport chains next.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Energy III Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1 The electron transport chain is composed of proteins that are located in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion (remember, the Krebs cycle occurs in the inner matrix of the mitochondria so the krebs cycle is located close to the electron transport chain). Each successive membrane protein in the electron transport chain has a greater electronegativity (affinity for electrons) than the protein preceding it. NADH and FADH2 deliver electrons to the first protein in the chain. The electrons are passed through the chain due to the increasing electronegativity of each member of the chain until they are stripped away from the chain by oxygen. Water is produced as a waste product when oxygen is reduced. A great deal of energy is released as electrons move from NADH or FADH2 to oxygen. This energy will be used to generate more ATP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2 Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell. This is because most of the energy that is gained from a glucose molecule is harvested during the Krebs cycle and electron transport - both of which are housed in the mitochondria. The mitochondria are double-membrane bound organelles - there is a smooth outer membrane and highly folded inner membrane. The Krebs cycle is located in the inner space of the mitochondria known as the matrix. The electron transport chain is embedded in the inner membrane. Inside a single mitochondrion there are many Krebs cycles and many electron transport chains - this allows each cell to make a great deal of ATP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3 To get an idea of our ATP needs we can look at these calculations. An adult woman needs to burn about 1600 kcal of fuel each day, and our body's fuel is ATP. Each mole of ATP releases about 8 kcal of energy and we can assume that we MAKE just enough ATP to get by in a day. So, doing the math we get: 1600 kcal/day/8 kcal/mol= 200 mol ATP/day. Then we can convert from moles of ATP per day to molecules of ATP/second: 200 mol/day/86400 sec/day= 2.3 x 10^-3 mol ATP /sec Then converting from moles to molecules: 2.3 x 10^-3 mol/sec x 6.02 x 10^23 molecules/mol= 1.4 x 10^21 molecules/sec. With approximately 10^14 cells in the human body, the rate would come to about 107 (10 million) ATP molecules/sec per cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4 This image from the tutorial shows the electron transport chain (in orange) embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. It is located next to an enzyme known as ATP synthase - this is the enzyme that will produce the ATP. This is a very important diagram and you should understand it fully to understand the final stages of cellular respiration. To discuss this stage - we will limit our discussion to the delivery of electrons by an NADH molecule and we will ignore FADH2. An NADH molecule with its full load of electrons travels to the electron transport chain and delivers it load of electrons. This regenerates the cell's supply of NAD+ - remember both gylcolysis and the Krebs cycle need a steady supply of NAD+ so this is very important. The NAD+ that is regenerated can now travel back to glycolyis and the krebs cycle so they can continue to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5 The electrons that were delivered by the NADH molecule are at a high free energy state - which means they are unstable and likely to participate in further redox reactions. Each molecule in the electron transport chain is increasingly electronegative so the electrons are pulled through the chain of molecules until they get stripped away from the chain by oxygen (which gets reduced to water). This movement of electrons from NADH to oxygen releases energy that the mitochondrion uses to pump hydrogen ions (or you can call them protons) across the inner mitochondrial membrane from the matrix to the inner membrane space. This can be difficult to understand so please spend time looking at this diagram and fully understanding the details. I have also posted some animations on ANGEL that can help you visualize this process. This movement of hydrogen ions across the inner mitochondrial membrane produces a voltage - in essence - the mitochondrion is like a battery. All of the hydrogen ions trapped in the inner membrane space have high free energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6 The enzyme ATP synthase (shown in gray) uses the energy in this voltage to drive the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP. This is known as oxidative phosphorylation or chemiosmosis (as opposed to the substrate level phosphorylation that we learned about in glycolysis and the krebs cycle). The generation of ATP from chemiosmosis is referred to as oxidative phosphorylation because oxygen's oxidative property allows a large amount of free energy to be made available for ATP synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7 At this point, we can look at the energy yield of the entire cellular respiration pathway. Glycolysis produces 2 ATP and 2 NADH. The conversion of pyruvate Acetyl CoA produces another 2 NADH. The Krebs cycle (going through 2 turns per glucose molecule) - produces another 2 ATP plus 6 NADH and 2 FADH2. When the NADH and FADH2 travel to the electron transport chain - they generate another 34 molecules of ATP (each NADH provides energy for 3 ATP and each FADH2 provides energy for 2 ATP). So, the overall energy gain for a respiring cell is 38ATP per glucose. This is a theoretical maximum - in reality most cells will produce fewer ATP molecules than this because of conditions both inside and outside of the cell. However, when we compare this to the ATP gain for a fermenting cell - 2 ATP from glycolysis - we see that respiration is a much more efficient process than fermentation.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Energy III Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1 Recall that at the end of glycolysis, there are two molecules of pyruvic acid. These pyruvic acid molecules have a lot of free energy and, if oxygen is present, can be further metabolized by the respiring cell. If no oxygen is present - the pyruvate is reduced during fermentation. Also recall that glycolysis has produced two molecules of NADH. We have already learned that if there is no oxygen present - the cell will use fermentation to regenerate the NAD+ needed by glycolysis. Now we will learn what happens to both pyruvate and NADH when oxygen is present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2 If oxygen is present pyruvate enters the Krebs cycle (in the form of acetyle CoA) and electrons go to the electron transport chain. NADH is oxidized by the electron transport chain to regenerate NAD+ (oxygen is the terminal e- acceptor).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3 Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell while the Krebs cycle enzymes are located in the mitochondria. In eukaryotes, pyruvate is transported across the mitochondrial membrane and then converted to acetyl CoA (with the production of NADH and carbon dioxide). Acetyl CoA is a 2-carbon compound. Acetyl CoA then enters the Krebs cycle. During the Krebs cycle, electrons are removed from acetyl CoA and these electrons reduce more NAD+, along with another electron carrier, FAD. The ATP that is produced is generated via substrate-level phosphorylation, just as in glycolysis. Each NADH and FADH2 molecule that is formed is an important source of energy that will be used to generate more ATP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4 So, where's the energy at this point? Starting with a single glucose molecule, a respiring cell will produce a net of 4 ATP at the end of the krebs cycle. All of the carbon has been lost as CO2 there is no more energy in the bonds of an organic molecule. So - where is the rest of the energy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5 To answer this question let's look at this view of the Krebs cycle. It is not necessary to know this level of detail but you should know the main inputs and outputs. Acetyl CoA enters the cycle and the electrons removed from this molecule are used to reduce NAD+ and FAD. After one turn of the cycle, 3 molecules of NADH are produced and one molecule of FADH2. A single molecule of ATP is also produced. For each glucose molecule - the cycle turns twice - because there were two pyruvate molecules produced during glycolysis. This means that per glucose - the Krebs cycle produces 2 ATP, 6NADH, and 2 FADH2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6 We can now answer this question. The rest of the energy that was once in the glucose molecule is now in the high energy electron carrier molecules - NADH and FADH2. Remember, these are high energy electron carrier molecules - there is free energy in the electrons these molecules carry and the next stage of respiration - the electron transport chain - will be able to convert that energy to energy if the form of more ATP molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;p&gt;Slide 1 If oxygen is not present - pyruvate is reduced to lactic acid or ethanol. This process is known as fermentation and it is an anaerobic process. During fermentation, NAD+ is regenerated. That is the goal of the fermentation pathways - to regenerate the cell's supply of NAD+ so glycolysis can continue to run. The ethanol and lactic acid that are produced are waste products to the cell. This is very important to understand - the goal of fermentation is to regenerate the cell's supply of NAD+ - not to make ethanol or lactic acid. In fact, these waste products are toxic to the cells that make them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2 This image from the tutorial shows the basic lactic acid and ethanol fermentation pathways. We will look at lactic acid fermentation first. Glycolysis is located on the right and we see NAD+ being consumed in glycolysis to produce NADH. During lactic acid fermentation, pyruvate is reduced to lactic acid by taking electrons from NADH. Remember, oxiation reducation reactions are always paired - as pyruvate gains electrons - NADH loses electrons and is regenerated to NAD+. The lactate that is produced is a waste product to the cell but the NAD+ that is regenerated can go back to glycolysis so glycolysis can continue to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3 Alchohol fermentation is similar except the production of ethanol occurs in two steps. First, pyruvate loses a carbon molecule in the form of CO2 and is converted to acetaldehyde. Then the acetylaldehyde is reduced to ethanol by accepting electrons from NADH. Just as in lactic acid fermentation, NAD+ has been regenerated and can go back to glycolysis and ethanol is a waste product to the cell. Notice - in neither of these pathways is there any ATP being produced. The only ATP produced by a fermenting organism is the net gain of 2 ATP molecules produced during glycolysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4 Lactic acid fermentation is done by some fungi, some bacteria like the Lactobacillus acidophilus in yogurt, and sometimes by our muscles. Normally our muscles use cellular respiration like the rest of our bodies, using O2 supplied via our lungs and blood. However, under greater exertion when the oxygen supplied by the lungs and blood system can't get there fast enough to keep up with the muscles&amp;nbsp;needs, our muscles can switch over and do lactic acid fermentation. Not for long however - keep running with insufficient oxygen and you will collapse! In the process of lactic acid fermentation, the 3-carbon pyruvic acid molecules are reduced to lactic acid. It is the presence of lactic acid in yogurt that gives it its sour taste, lactic acid produced by the bacteria and/or fungi in many cheeses that gives those cheeses their characteristic flavors, and it is the presence of lactic acid in our muscles that makes them burn when we work out vigorously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5 Alcohol fermentation is done by yeast and some kinds of bacteria. The waste products of this process are ethanol and carbon dioxide (CO2). Humans have long taken advantage of this process in making bread, beer, and wine. In bread making, it is the CO2 which causes the bread to rise, and the ethanol evaporating that gives bread its wonderful smell while baking. It is the CO2 produced by the process of fermentation that makes beer bubbly. Remember - ethanol is a waste product to the yeast that produce it. But it is a waste product with significant free energy. When we consume ethanol - we are consuming a high energy molecule and because we are efficient at conserving excess calories in the form of fat - it is quite easy to get a beer belly from this waste product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6 To summarize what we know about fermentation first, it is an anaerobic process - no oxygen is used Second, the purpose of fermentation is to regenerate the cell's supply of NAD+ Third, lactate and ethanol are waste products! And finally, there is no energy gain for the cell during fermentation - a fermenting organism has a net gain of 2 ATP/glucose from glycolysis.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Energy II Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1 Cellular respiration occurs in three stages. The first is glycolysis, the the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain with oxidative phosphorylation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2 Glycolysis is a complex biochmical pathway that involves ten steps and ten intermediate compounds. It is the pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate and releases energy for ATP production. For this course, we do not need to learn glycolysis in this level of detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3 Instead we can learn the process in this level of detail. During glycolysis glucose is broken down into 2 molecules of pyruvte or pyruvic acid (you can use either name). Glucose is a 6-carbon molecule and pyruvate is a 3-carbon molecule. Remember, it takes an input of energy to break the chemical bonds of a molecule - and glycolysis requires an input of 2 molecules of ATP to start the process. As glucose is modified through the glycolytic pathway - a total of 4 ATP molecules are generated. This means that at the end of glycolysis - there is a net gain of 2 ATP molecules. This is energy for the cell to use to do cell work. There is also a movement of electrons from the intermediates of the glycolytic pathway to two molecules of NAD+ to produce 2 molecules of NADH. We will see where this molecule gets used later. The pyruvate that is produced by this pathway is a 3-carbon compound that still has a good deal of free energy associated with it. We will see what happens to this pyruvate later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4 There are two ways for a cell to make an ATP molecule. Either through substrate-level phosphorylation as shown here or through a process known as oxidative phosphorylation as we will see later. Phosphorylation means to add a phosphate group to something. So ADP gets phosphorylated to ATP during cellular respiration. Substrate level phosphorylation occurs when an enzyme known as a kinase transfers the phosphate group from one molecule to another. In this image we see pyruvate kinase moving a phosphate group from PEP to ADP. During glycolysis, the 4 ATP that are made, are all made by substrate-level phosphorylation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5 Let's do some energy bookkeeping at this point. To start glycolysis - 2 ATP molecules are used to split one molecule of glucose. At the end of glycolysis, the pathway has produced 4 ATP, 2 NADH, and 2 molecules of pyruvate. In terms of energy gain for the cell - the net energy gain is 2 ATP (4 ATP minus the 2 ATP invested) and 2 NADH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6 Pyruvate is a 3-carbon molecule that still contains a lot of free energy. At the end of glycolysis, there are 2 molecules of pyruvate. Cells have evolved to be efficient - the pyruvate will be used by the cell. All cells use the glycolysis pathway - whether we are talking about prokaryotes or eukaryotes, plants or animals - all cells use glycolysis. Because all cells use glycolysis - that means all cells use NAD+. Rememember, during glycolysis NAD+ is reduced to NADH. In order for glycolysis to keep running (and a cell to stay alive) - the cell must have a steady supply of NAD+. NAD+ is an expensive molecule for a cell to make so there is a limited supply. This means that cells must regenerate their supply of NAD+.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7 What happens to the pyruvate and the NADH depends upon whether or not oxygen is present and available for the cell to use. If oxygen is present the pyruvate goes to the next stage of cellular respiration - the Krebs cyle. It does not go into the Krebs cycle directly but is converted into a molecule known as acetyl CoA. If oxygen is present the NADH that was produced in glycolysis is oxidized to NAD+ at the electron transport chain. We will see both these events in the next tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 8 If oxygen is not present - pyruvate is reduced to lactic acid or ethanol. This process is known as fermentation (not anaerobic respiration although you may have mistakenly learned this) During fermentation, NAD+ is regenerated. We will see this next.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Energy II Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Energy II Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1 In this tutorial we are going to begin talking about cellular respiration. Cellular respiration refers to the ability of cells to use the energy in a glucose molecule and convert that energy to energy in the form of ATP. Molecules besides glucose can be respired but we are going to look solely at the respiration of glucose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2 To understand cellular respiration, we must understand the basics of chemical reactions known as redox reactions. Redox refers to oxidation and reduction which are reactions that involve the transfer of electrons from one compound to another. Oxidation is the loss of an electron or electrons and reduction is the gain of an electron or electrons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3 Oxygen is highly electronegative which means it has a strong attraction for electrons. As we will see - it is this high electronegativity that allows us to get so much energy from a glucose molecule. We need oxygen because of its ability to pull electrons toward itself. When electrons move - energy is lost and gained. The oxidized compound loses energy when it loses electrons and the reduced compound gains energy when it gains electrons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4 During cellular respiration, electrons move from a high energy state when they are part of the glucose molecule to a low energy state when they are grabbed by oxygen. It is the release of energy associated with the movement of electrons that cells use to generate ATP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5 We can get an idea of the amount of energy that is available to cells by observing a combustion reaction. Methane is a high energy compound - in the presence of oxygen electrons are released from methane and travel to oxygen. This results in a large release of energy - in this case an explosive release of energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6 The explosive heat that is released from the combustion of a high energy compound like glucose is not useful for biological organisms. While organisms need a certain amount of heat to stay alive - heat itself is not a form of energy that can drive a cellular reaction. So rather than releasing energy in one explosive step - cellular respiration occurs in a series of small manageable steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7 The overall process of cellular respiration is an oxidation-reduction reaction in which glucose is oxidized to carbon dioxide and oxygen is reduced to water. The movement of electrons from glucose to oxygen releases energy and the cell can use that energy to produce ATP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 8 During cellular respiration, the movement of electrons must take place in small manageable steps. This means the cell needs an electron carrier molecule. This molecule is a molecule known as NAD+. Its job is to carry electrons from one stage of cellular respiration to the next. We can think of NAD+ as being like a dump truck and its job is to deliver loads of electrons to various stages of cellular respiration. The oxidized form of the molecule is NAD+ and we can think of it as being an empty dump truck. The reduced form is NADH and we can think of it as being a full dumptruck - it carries a load of electrons. This molecule is hugely important in the energy needs of a cell and it is an expensive molecule for cells to make. Just as you would not throw out a dumptruck after it delivers a load of supplies - a cell also does not throw out an NAD+ molecule after it has delivered a load of electrons. Conserving this molecule is important and this is an important idea to keep in mind as we continue to discuss cellular respiration.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Energy I Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Energy I Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;br&gt;​&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;There are two laws of thermodynamics that will be important for you to understand so that you understand cellular metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first law of thermodynamics can be stated in several ways.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can say that the amount of energy in the universe is constant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or we can say that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, but only converted from one form to another&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to say this law is to sat that the energy used and released in any reaction must be balanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people even describe this law as "there is no free lunch" - this means that energy must come from somewhere and it isn't free!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;One of the goals of this course is to improve your critical thinking skills.&amp;nbsp; This has relevance not only in the classroom but in your everyday life. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are always con artists who are willing to take your money through promises of miraculous medical cures or, as seen here, the promise of free electricity through the use of perpetual motion machines.&amp;nbsp; Perpetual motion refers to the movement of a machine without any input of external energy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A basic scientific understanding of the first law of thermodynamics along with some critical thinking skills tells us that this is not possible!&amp;nbsp; Perpetual motion is not physically possible here on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;The closest I have come to believing in perpetual motion is when watching my Chihuahua Speedy.&amp;nbsp; As you can see in this picture - he is blurry because he never stops moving!&amp;nbsp; But I have to feed him so even with a Chihuahua there is no such thing as a free lunch or pepetual motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;The Second Law of Thermodynamics refers to the tendency of the universe to tend toward disorder.&amp;nbsp; Like the first law, it can be stated in many different ways. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can say that matter is becoming more random.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or we can point out that entropy is increasing in the universe.&amp;nbsp; Entropy is a measure of disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way of stating the second law is to say that all energy in the universe is tending toward heat.&amp;nbsp; Heat is the most random form of energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it may be best to think about the second law in terms of familiar observations.&amp;nbsp; This image shows a nice red shed.&amp;nbsp; If no energy is put into maintaining this shed it will fall into disarray as disorder or entropy increases.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To return the shed to good order - energy must be put into the system.&amp;nbsp; This shed is a good analogy for our cells and our bodies.&amp;nbsp; If we do not take in energy to do cell work and maintain our cells and bodies - we fall into disrepair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As work is done on the shed or as we do cellular work - heat is returned to the environment.&amp;nbsp; As the most random form of energy - this heat is not useful to drive biological processes.&amp;nbsp; Luckily we have a constant input of energy into the biosphere in the form of sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;Our sun provides energy to plants and other photosynthetic organisms.&amp;nbsp; These organisms produce high energy compounds such as glucose that provide energy to all other organims.&amp;nbsp; So, as long as the sun is shining on earth - we will have energy that we can use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;But what happens when the sun stops shining....&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Energy I Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Energy I Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;Earlier in the course, we attempted to define life.&amp;nbsp; We cannot come up with one simple perfect definition but we do know that all living things are highly ordered and living things grow, reproduce, respond to the environment, and regulate their internal environments. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these processes require energy so all living things require a constant supply of energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of energy, organisms are open systems.&amp;nbsp; This means that they take in energy from the environment and also return energy to the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the organism we are talking about is an animal - the energy comes in the form of food. If the organism is a plant - the energy comes from sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;To discuss the energy requirements of organisms, we must define energy.&amp;nbsp; We can't see energy but we can observe what energy does to matter.&amp;nbsp; When matter moves - energy is acting upon that matter. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy occurs in two basic classes.&amp;nbsp; One class is potential energy.&amp;nbsp; This is energy that matter has due to its position or location so it is stored energy. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, when this ball is at the top of a hill - it has stored energy.&amp;nbsp; As we will talk about (and as you obviously know from your observations of the world) - it is likely that this ball will roll down hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;As the ball rolls down hill, the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy.&amp;nbsp; Kinetic energy is the energy of moving matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;Our analysis of energy is going to focus on the energy of chemical bonds.&amp;nbsp; Our model molecule will be the sugar glucose - because glucose is a common energy source for organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glucose is a 6-carbon sugar that has a lot of energy stored in its chemical bonds.&amp;nbsp; When we use glucose for energy - there needs to be a small input of energy to break these bonds.&amp;nbsp; However, when the bonds reform to create the breakdown products of glucose metabolism - more energy is released than was invested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;Let's look at a sample problem from the practice tutorial questions to illustrate this idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organisms like ourselves use glucose as an energy source but we need oxygen to fully breakdown glucose.&amp;nbsp; When the bonds reform they reform to produce carbon dioxide and water.&amp;nbsp; We will be learning more about this in the next tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breakdown of glucose requires breaking all of the Carbon-Carbon bonds and all of the Carbon-Hydrogen bonds. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image of glucose is a typical representation of an organic molecule.&amp;nbsp; To understand this representation you need to know that there is a Carbon atom at each corner of the molecule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pause this recording and see if you can count all of the carbon-carbon bonds and all of the carbon-hydrogen bonds.&amp;nbsp; Once you have counted them all - hit play again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;You should have counted 5 carbon-carbon bonds and 7 carbon-hydrogen bonds.&amp;nbsp; Remember, there is a carbon at each corner of the molecule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now - calculate the total amount of energy that must be invested to break these bonds.&amp;nbsp; Pause the recording and hit play when you have calculated the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7&lt;br&gt;The answer is C - 1017 kcal/mole. This means it takes 1017 kcal of energy to break the bonds in a glucose molecule.&amp;nbsp; This is the energy investment phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 8&lt;br&gt;But the goal of breaking down a glucose molecule is to gain energy to do cell work.&amp;nbsp; So next let's think about how much energy is gained.&amp;nbsp; This question tells you that 1703 kcal of energy are gained when the broken bonds reform around oxygen.&amp;nbsp; So how much energy is gained?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pause the recording to calculate the energy gain from metabolizing a molecule of glucose. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 9&lt;br&gt;The answer is B - 686 kcal/mole.&amp;nbsp; This means that when we metabolize a molecule of glucose - we get an energy gain of 686 kcals of energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 10&lt;br&gt;This is why we eat.&amp;nbsp; We need energy to do cell work and that energy come from our food.&amp;nbsp; We will focus on glucose as our food source but we also get energy from eating proteins and fats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we study the energy uses of organisms - we are talking about thermodynamics.&amp;nbsp; Thermodynamics is the study of energy transformations within a system. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organisms are open systems - we take in energy from our environments but we also return energy to our environments. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these energy transformations within our cells are collectively referred to as our metabolism. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our metabolism is made up of anabolic reactions and catabolic reactions.&amp;nbsp; Recall from our earlier discussions that anabolic reactions are energy requiring reactions that build macromolecules.&amp;nbsp; It should make intuitive sense that it takes energy to build a large complex molecule.&amp;nbsp; Catabolic reactions are energy releasing reactions that result in the breakdown of a macromolecule.&amp;nbsp; When an energy rich molecule like glucose is broken down - energy is released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be looking at these ideas in more detail in the next several tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Plants III Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The angiosperm life cycle is similar to the gymnosperm life cycle in that it shows complete reduction of the gametophyte and the female gametophyte remains enclosed within sporophyte tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where gymosperms have cones - angiosperms have flowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anther produces pollen while the female ovules contain an egg cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the pollen lands on the stigma - fertilization can take place to produce the zygote which then grows into the embryo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The embryo is housed within a seed and the seed is housed within fruit derived from the ovary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The seeds are released from the parent plant and can then germinate to produce a new individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process of fertilization in the angiosperms is known as double fertilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pollen grain contains two haploid sperm nuclei&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The megaspore - the female gametophyte - contains nne haploid egg nucleus and two haploid polar nuclei.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When fertilization takes place, one sperm fertilizes the egg to produce the diploid embryo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other sperm combines with the 2 polar nuclei to produce the triploid endosperm - this endosperm nourishes the embryo until it germinates and can begin to photosynthesize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The angiosperms are divided into two groups depending on the type of seed produced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monocots include plants like corn and the other grasses. &amp;nbsp;The monocots have a single embryonic seed leaf (this seed leaf is known as a cotyledon).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dicots which include beans and other broadleaf plants have two embryonic seed leafs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both types of seed tend to have a significant amount of endosperm so seeds can survive in the environment until conditions are right for germination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Plants III Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The angiosperms - otherwise known as the flowering plants - are the dominant plant group on earth today with approximately 275,000 known species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flower is the reproductive structure of the plant that is derived from modified leaves and plays an important role in pollination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seeds of the angiosperms are considered "housed" seeds because the seed is complete enclosed within an ovary - which is the fruit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fruit and flowers are responsible for the success of this group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flower contains either male reproductive structures, female reproductive structures, or both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The male part of the flower is known as the stamen and it is comprised of the anther and the filament. &amp;nbsp;The anther produces the pollen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The female part of the plant is known as the carpel and is made up of the stigma, style, and ovary. &amp;nbsp;The ovary houses the egg which will become fertilized to produce the zygote. &amp;nbsp;After fertilization, the ovary will develop into the fruit and house the seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The petals of the flower typically are colorful and attract animal pollinators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flowers are the reproductive structure of the angiosperms and they can be classified as either perfect - which means they have both male and female parts on the same flower or imperfect - which means the flower has either male or female parts but not both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many species of angiosperm take advantage of animals for pollination and seed dispersal (including humans)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This ability to take advantage of animals is what has made the angiosperms so succesful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When pollen lands on the stigma it grows a pollen tube into an ovule where it deposits two sperm nuclei - this is a process known as double fertilization.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pollination is the process of moving pollen from one plant to another and, in the angiosperms, it often involves an animal pollinator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all angiosperms take advantage of animal pollinators. &amp;nbsp;Some use the wind for pollination. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Characteristics of wind pollinated plants include that they produce large amounts of pollen, and small inconspicuous flowers. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pollen travels &lt;100 meters so wind pollinated plants must grow close together&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trees (oaks) and grasses are often wind pollinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wind pollination is a wasteful process - if the wind blows the wrong way - all that pollen and all that reproductive effort is wasted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Animal pollinated plants produce smaller amounts of pollen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of putting energy into abundant pollen production they put their energy into producing large, showy flowers - these flowers attract pollinators, often give a them a reward - such as nectar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pollinators can carry pollen large distances so animal pollinated plants can be widely separated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 9&lt;br&gt;All kinds of animals can be pollinators - insects, birds and even mammals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The features of the flower fit the pollinator. &amp;nbsp;Insects tend to be attracted to yellow flowers with flat surfaces for landing. &amp;nbsp;Birds are attracted to red and hummingbirds hover in front of the flower and don't need to land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bats are active at night so bat-pollinated plants are typically white and highly scented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some plants even attract beetles and flies as pollinators - this flower is the color of meat and has the pungent odor of rotting flesh - beetles anf flies love it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some plants take advantage of animals but do not give them a reward. &amp;nbsp;Orchids in the genus Ophrys are wasp and bee mimics. &amp;nbsp;They produce pheromones that mimic the pheromones of a female and they even look like a female. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Male wasps come and attempt to copulate with the flower. &amp;nbsp;In the process they pick up pollen and then deliver it to another flower. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They do not get any nectar or other food. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These orchids are parasites. &amp;nbsp;They essentially steal reproductive energy from the wasps.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Plants II Part 3 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The non-flowering seed plants are those plants that produce seeds but do not produce flowers or fruits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gymnosperms arose about 300 million years ago when conditions on earth were drier than they had been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this time, all of the earth's land masses were connected in one super continent called Pangaea. &amp;nbsp;This super continent helped to create drier conditions and this created a new habitat for plants to move into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gymnosperms have adaptations that make them better able to tolerate dry conditions than either the nonvascular or the vascular seedless plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gymnosperms are our first example of a seed plant. In the seed plants we see a further development in the trend toward a reduced gametophyte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the seed plants, the gametophyte is fully reduced and dependent upon the sporophyte for nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The female gametophyte stays completely within the sporophyte tissue. &amp;nbsp;The male gametophyte is the pollen grain - it briefly leaves the sporophyte tissue when it travels to the female gametophyte prior to fertilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeds are multicellular resistant structures that houses the embryonic sporophyte and provides a food supply for the developing embryo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeds are used to disperse embryos into the environment away from the parent plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gymnosperm seeds are "naked" - they are not surrounded by fruit the way the seeds ofthe angiosperms are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seed plants produce pollen. &amp;nbsp;Pollen is not found in the nonvascular or the vascular seedless plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pollen is the male gametophyte that houses the sperm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pollen grains have a hard coat that protects the sperm cells during the process of their movement to the female gametophyte (cones in gymnosperm and flowers in the angiosperms)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gymnosperms do not usually use animals to spread their pollen - they tend to use the wind. &amp;nbsp;So the pollen of most gymnosperms has wing-like structures that allow them to fly better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angiosperms tend to use animals as pollinators so their polen tends to have rigid projections that better enable to grains to attach to the surface of an animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gymnosperms used to be the most abundant plant group on earth but today there are fewer than 750 species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are four phyla of gymnosperms but none of these groups is thought to be monophyletic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first two groups of gymnosperms are the cycads and ginkgos. &amp;nbsp;Both of these groups retain the primitive characterstic of flagellated sperm even though they do not require water for reproduction. &amp;nbsp;The sperm actually swim through a tube that grows from the pollen grain into the female cone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both the cycads and ginkgos are dioecious - this means that there are separate sexes - one plant is male and the other is female.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The cycads are a tropical and subtropical groups of plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ginkgos are considered to be a living fossil - there is only a single species in the whole group - the plant Ginkgo biloba. &amp;nbsp;This is the tree that is the source of the dietary suplement Ginkgo biloba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gnetophytes are the next group of gymnosperms. &amp;nbsp;They have many charactersistics that make them unique but we are going to focus on the fact that this is the first group of plants we are looking at that has the advanced characterstic of non-motile sperm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gnetophytes include some strange plants like Welwitschia and ephedra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 9&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ephedra is also known as Ma huang or Chinese ephedra. &amp;nbsp;It is the source of the dietary supplement known as ephedra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ephedra is a stimulant that decreases apetite - unfortunately it can also cause heart attacks or strokes and has been linked to a number of deaths - including the deaths of young, healthy athletes. &amp;nbsp;In 2004 the Food and Drug Administration banned the use of ephedra in supplements in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last group of gymnosperms is the conifers. &amp;nbsp;This group also has non-motile sperm is recognized as being plants that have cones and evergreen leaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the conifers are monoecious - both sexes are found on one tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conifers are noteable for having the largest known tree - the General Sherman tree that lives in Sequoia National Park - and the oldest known tree - the Methuselah tree in the White mountains of California is just shy of 5000 years old!&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Plants II Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This fern is exhibiting a homosporous life cycle. &amp;nbsp;This fern produces a single spore type that gives rise to a bisexual gametophyte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The part of the fern that we think of as the fern - is the sporophyte. &amp;nbsp;On the underside of the leaves are structures known as sporangia that produce the spores via meiosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;A spore is released from the parent plant when the wind blows, the rain falls, or an animal brushes against it. &amp;nbsp;That spore disperses into the environment and grows into a gametophyte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gametophyte is bisexual - it has both male and female gamete producing structures on the same gametophyte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sperm are flagellated so they must swim to the egg for fertilization to take place. &amp;nbsp;Fertilization produces the diploid zygote which then grows into a new multicellular sporophyte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This image shows the sporangia - the spore producing structures - on the underside of a fern leaf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom image is a closeup of a single sporangium with spores forming inside.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These spores will be released from the sporangium and grow into a gametophyte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top image shows a gametophyte and the blue circular structures are archegonia - the egg producing structures at 100 times magnification.&lt;br&gt;The gametophyte is independent at this stage - it is not associated with any sporophyte tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bottom image shows a gametophyte after fertilization has taken place and the sporophyte is growing out of the gametophyte. &amp;nbsp;Eventually the gametophyte will atrophy and wither away and only the sporophyte will remain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This remaining sporophyte will produces more spores so the life cycle can continue.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Plants II Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;The seedless vascular plants were the second major group of plants to evolve. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vascular seedless plants are not a monophyletic group but they all share the characteristic of having vascular tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vascular tissue allows the plant to move water and nutrients around the body of the plant - this reduces the chances of desiccation and allows the plant to grow larger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, some of the early vascular seedless plants were tree sized - ferns up to 30 feet tall as seen as the artists recreation of what earth may have looked like about 300 million years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only were ferns huge at this time - insects such as dragon flies were as well. &amp;nbsp;Recent research suggests that this is because oxygen levels in the atmosphere were significantly higher and this enabled larger organismal growht.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the presence of vascular tissue which prevents desiccation - the ferns and other vascular seedless plants retain the primitive characteristics of flagellated sperm so they still require water for reproduction. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vascular tissue is specialized tissue that transports water and nutrients around the body of the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xylem is the tissue that transports water and mineralse from the soil to other parts of the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phloem transports the sugars that are produced by photosynthesis. &amp;nbsp;These sugars are transported all over the plant and can be stored as starch in the roots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vascular plants have true roots, leaves, and stems because they have vascular tissue. &amp;nbsp;Compare this to the rhizoids of the mosses - rhizoids are not true roots because they do not have vascular tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lignin is a structural polysaccharide that is associated with xylem. &amp;nbsp;It provides structural support to vascular plants - highly lignified tissue becomes "woody" and strong. &amp;nbsp;Plants with a large amount of lignin can become quite large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spores are reproductive structures that are adapted for dispersal and surviving for extended periods of time in unfavorable conditions. &amp;nbsp;Typically spores are haploid and unicellular and they are produced by the sporophyte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like the nonvascular plants - the vascular seedless plants do not produce pollen, flowers, or seeds and they rely on spores for dispersal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we saw earlier, many of the mosses are heterosporous - they produce megaspores which produce female gametophytes and microspores which produce male gametophytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the vascular seedless plants are homosporous - they produce a single spore type which gives rise to a bisexual gametophyte.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vascular plants have a prominent sporophyte generation in their life cycle (in comparison to the nonvascular plants that have a prominent gametophyte).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the sporophyte is prominent the gametophyte is still independent (we will see that this changes when we get to the seed plants). &amp;nbsp;An independent gametophyte means that it lives independently for part of the life cycle and is capable of photosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nonvascular plants are the only ones with a prominent gametophyte. &amp;nbsp;All other plants have a prominent sporophyte so there must be a selective advantage to a prominent sporophyte. &amp;nbsp;What do you think this advantage might be? &amp;nbsp;The hint is that it has to do with UV radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Remember, the sporophyte generation is diploid - it has two copies of each gene while the gametophyte generation is haploid and only has one copy of each gene.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UV radiation is a mutagen - it mutates DNA. &amp;nbsp;An organism that has two copies of each gene is protected against the negative effects of UV radiation more than an organism with just one copy of each gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second copy is insurance against mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examples of the vascular seedless plants are the ferns as well as the club mosses and equisetum - also known as horsetails.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Plants I Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are challenges to living on land. &amp;nbsp;Life evolved in the water and so the move to a terrestrial environment could not happen until organisms developed adaptations that allowed them to deal with land's challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For plants, two of the most important challenges are that land is dry and that land is not buoyant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aquatic plants donít need to worry about drying out - they are bathed in water at all times. &amp;nbsp;But plants on land do not enjoy the constant presence of water - they have developed characteristics that allow them to live without water's constant presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aquatic plants also donít need structural tissue to provide support - the water provides structural support. &amp;nbsp;On land - plants need specialized tissue to provide structural support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One adaptation that terrestrial plants have to life on land is a waxy cuticle.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waxes are lipids and thus are hydrophobic. &amp;nbsp;A waxy cuticle is a layer on the surface of the leaves and stems that keeps water inside the body of the plant. &amp;nbsp;This helps prevent drying out of the plant but the cuticle also prevents the movement of carbon dioxide and oxygen into and out of the plant. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbon dioxide needs to enter the leaves for photosynthesis to take place and the oxygen by-product needs to get out of the leaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stomata help solve this problem. &amp;nbsp;Stomata are pores on the surface of plant leaves that allow the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stomata are capable of opening and closing in response to the needs of the plants. &amp;nbsp;When the stomata are open - like this one here - carbon dioxide and water can move in and out. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the stomata are closed - like this one here - gases cannot move through. &amp;nbsp;So, why would a plant close its stomata? &amp;nbsp;Because water vapor can also move through the stomata. &amp;nbsp;This means that if a plant keeps it stomata open - it risks drying out. &amp;nbsp;So the stomata open and close in an attempt to maximize gas exchange while at the same time minimizing water loss.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vascular tissue is another adaptation to the challenges of life on land. &amp;nbsp;Vascular tissue is tissue that moves water and nutrients through the body of the plant. &amp;nbsp;Water needs to move from the roots up to the leaves and sugars that are produced by photosynthesis need to move from the leaves to other parts of the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evolution of vascular tissue allowed for an increase in plant size. &amp;nbsp;The nonvascular plants like the mosses lack this tissue and they do not get very large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vascular plants, on the other hand, can get very large, &amp;nbsp;Think of the giant redwood trees of Northern California - their immense size is due to the presence of vascular tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vascular tissue prevents desiccation because it moves water around the plant and it can also become rigid and provide structural support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most sensitive stage of the life cycle for any organism is the embryonic stage. &amp;nbsp;The gametes are also sensitive cells. &amp;nbsp;Both embryos and gametes cannot survive desiccation so to be succesful on land - the land plants protect both gametes and embryos in jacketed tissues known as gametangia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tissue protects the gametes, zygote, and embryo be encasing them in a resistant cell layer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Pollen is another adaptation to the terrestrial environment. &amp;nbsp;Not all plants produce pollen but the two groups that do - the gymnosperms and the angiosperms - are able to live in far drier environments than plants that do not make pollen - the mosses and ferns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pollen is a resistant structure that houses the male gametophyte - the structure that makes the sperm. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pollen not only prevents dessication of the male gametes but it allows for greater plant dispersal because pollen-producing plants can use animals - like this honeybee - to transport pollen grains greater distances than an unprotected sperm can swim. We will talk about this idea in more detail when we discuss the pollen-producing plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like pollen - seeds are only found in two groups of plants - the same two that make pollen - the gymnosperms and the angiosperms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeds are resistant structures that house the plant embryo. &amp;nbsp;The seed not only protects the embryo from drying out but it also provides the embryo with a supply of nutrients - the seed contains an embryo and its food supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seed also allows greater dispersal of plants - seeds can be carried by wind, water, or animals and thus spread individuals into new areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both pollen and seeds are found in plants that tolerate dry environments and are able to disperse offspring far from the parent plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flowers and fruit are the most recent evolutionary advances of the land plants. &amp;nbsp;These features are found only in one group of plants - the angiosperms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flowers increase fertilization by attracting animal pollinators - animals carry pollen from one plant to another. &amp;nbsp;Because the movement of animals is purposeful (as opposed to say the wind blowing or water flowing) - pollen can be moved efficiently from one plant to another and fertilization is improved. &amp;nbsp;The Mountain Laurel is the Pennsylvania state flower and a nice example of a flowering plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fruits develop from flowers and house the seeds. &amp;nbsp;Fruits aid in seed dispersal often by using animals to spread seeds. &amp;nbsp;This cedar waxwing is eating the fruits of the Mountain ash tree - the fruit will travel through his digestive system and he will deposit the seeds in a location away from the parent plant. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of flowers and fruits has allowed the angiosperms to become the most succesful group of plants on earth.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Plants I Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;As we move through our survey of biodiversity, we are now going to begin talking about the plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are four main categories of plants - however these groups are probably not monophyletic and just as we saw with the protists - the taxonomy of plants is being reconsidered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, we will still discuss the plants in a way that reflects our prior understanding of how these organisms evolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This diagram shows the four main groups of plants as well as the green algae ancestor that is most closely related to the true plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The four main groups of plants are the non-vascular plants, seedless vascular plants, non-flowering seed plants, and the flowering plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The true plants are thought to have evolved from a green algal ancestor known as a Charophyte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;The characteristics that are shared by plants and green algae are chlorophyll b (remember all photosynthetic organisms use chlorophyll a but only the plants and green algae use chlorophyll b), carboydrates stored as starch, a cell wall made of cellulose, and modern genetic analyses show similar DNA sequences in the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;To understand the evolution of plants we need to understand what the earth looked like 500 million years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that time there was very little eukaryotic terrestrial life so the terrestrial environment was open for colonization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, UV radiation hitting the earth was too powerful - remember that UV radiation is a mutagen - it damages DNA and this damage was too much for most organisms to tolerate. &amp;nbsp;So most life existed in the water where UV radiation cannot cause as much damage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evolution of photosynthesis was causing the accumulation of O2 that resulted in the production of the ozone layer. &amp;nbsp;The ozone layer provides protection from UV radiation by blocking the amount of radiation that hits the surface of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The development of the ozone layer made life in a terrestrial environment more tenable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advantages of a terrestrial life for plants include that water attenuates light and reduces photosynthetic rates. &amp;nbsp;Moving to land allows a great photosynthetic rate. &amp;nbsp;There was also no herbivory on land because animals had not moved to land yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disadvantages of terrestrial life include desiccation - particularly of water-sensitive gametes and embryos - and the loss of physical&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;support that water provides. &amp;nbsp;Water is bouyant and gravity does not have as great an effect in water. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;On land, organisms need some sort of physical support to deal with this loss of bouyancy and support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The movement onto land most likely resulted when a green algal ancestor lived in shallow waters that were subject to periodic flooding and draining of the habitat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural selection favored algae that could survive periods of drying out - and this set the stage for the move to land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The colonization of land is known to have occured at least 450 mya but it may have occured earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once plants moved to land - they rapidly diversified because there was so much available habitat and very little competition from other organisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;While we know quite a bit about plant evolution, the fossil record for some types of plants is limited because plants tend to have soft body parts. &amp;nbsp;Generally it is organisms with hard body parts that fossilize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, we do have key plant fossils that have allowed us to understand the story of plant evolution.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Genetics Selection and Speciation Part 6 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Genetics Selection and Speciation Part 6 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;The Prezygotic and postzygotic isolating mechanisms described earlier, explain how closely related species stay separate. &amp;nbsp;But how did they become distinct species in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two basic ways for speciation to occur - allopatric and sympatric speciation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;The prefix allo means other while the prefix sym means same. &amp;nbsp;The suffix patric means homeland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;Allopatric speciation requires a physical or geographical barrier between populations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sympatric speciation requires genetic isolation even when populations ranges overlap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;This image illustrates the difference between these two processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allopatric speciation, on the left, requires a physical barrier to form between the two populations and speciation ultimately results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sympatric speciation, on the right, occurs when populations diverge due to some biological barrier between them - not a physical barrier. &amp;nbsp;The two populations inhabit the same area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;An example of allopatric speciation is the divergence of two populations of antelope squirrels into separate species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Grand Canyon is a barrier to dispersal by small mammals, and as a consequence the isolated populations can diverge and become distinct species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;Allopatric speciation is frequently seen on islands. &amp;nbsp;This image shows the speciation of a mainland population of kingfishers into several different island species of kingfishers. &amp;nbsp;Individuals from the mainland dispersed to the islands where they were geographically and thus genetically isolated from each other. &amp;nbsp;Over time genetic differences accumulated to the point where they are all different species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 7&lt;br&gt;This type of island colonization and subsequent speciation is referred to as adaptive radiation. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In adaptive radiation a single species colonizes an island and adapts to that island and becomes a distinct species. &amp;nbsp;The individuals from the new species subsequently disperse to another island in the group and then adapts to that new environment and another new species evolves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several classic examples of adaptive radiation including Darwinís Finches on the Galapagos islands and Hawaiian Silverswords on the Hawaiian islands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 8&lt;br&gt;Sympatric speciation can be more difficult to conceptualize because populations are not physically separated from each other but some factor creates genetic isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is commonly observed in plants. &amp;nbsp;Some plants can self-fertilize and, if there was an error during mitosis or meiosis, they may produce polyploid offspring. &amp;nbsp;Polyploids have more than the diploid number of chromosomes. &amp;nbsp;Because the offspring have a different number of chromosomes from the parents - they are genetically isolated and a speciation event can occur.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Genetics Selection and Speciation Part 5 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;Reproductive isolation can be achieved either through prezygotic mating isolation or postzygotic mating isolation as we will now discuss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;Postzygotic isolating mechanisms refer to situations where a zygote forms but the embryo cannot survive and develop into a mature individual or an individual is born and survives to adulthood but cannot reproduce successfully by producing fertile offspring&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hybrid inviability refers to a situation where the genes from the two different species cannot function properly together and the embryo dies before birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is seen in matings between sheep and goats. &amp;nbsp;Sheep and goats are closely related but they cannot produce hybrids because of gene incompatibility which leads to loss of the embryo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;Hybrid Infertility refers to a situation where hybrid offspring are born but they cannot reproduce. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of this is when a donkey is crossed with a horse to produce a mule. &amp;nbsp;Male donkeys have a diploid chromosome number of 62 (so their sperm contain 31 chromosomes) and female horses have a diploid chromosome number of 64 - so their eggs have 32 chromosomes. &amp;nbsp;When a sperm with 31 chromosomes fertilizes an egg with 32 chromosomes - the result is that the zyogte has 63 chromosomes - an uneven number. &amp;nbsp;The unpaired chromosome causes problems during meiosis and the mule usually cannot produce normal sperm or eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;But there are always exceptions. &amp;nbsp;In 2007 a mule in Colorado named Kate gave birth to a foal (this has been documented a few other times as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, nobody can adequately explain how this happened - although researchers are working hard to figure out how a female mule can successfully reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Genetics Selection and Speciation Part 4 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Genetics Selection and Speciation Part 4 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;There are some basic steps that must take place for a speciation event to occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 1:† gene flow between two populations is interrupted&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;and populations become genetically isolated from each other&lt;br&gt;Step 2:† genetic differences gradually accumulate between the two populations &amp;nbsp;and the populations diverge genetically&lt;br&gt;Step 3:† reproductive isolation evolves as a consequence of this divergence and a reproductive isolating mechanism evolves&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;This image from the tutorial illustrates the possible ways that populations can become reproductively isolated from each other. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, these mechanisms can be described as either pre-zygotic (occuring before a zygote forms) or post-zygotic (occuring after a zygote forms).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prezygotic isolating mechanisms are habitat isolation, temporal isolation, behavioral isolation, mechanical isolation and gametic isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;An example of habitat or geographical isolation are stickleback fish species. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pungitius pungitius is a brackish water form of the 9-spine stickleback (brackish water is water that is a mix of fresh water and salt water). &amp;nbsp;These fish build their nests and reproduce in water with a salinity of 13.5% and an average temperature of 13.3 oC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pungitius tymensis is a freshwater form of a stickleback known as the Sakhalin stickleback. &amp;nbsp;They overlap in range with the 9-spine stickleback but they build their nests and reproduce in water with a salinity of less than 1% and average temperature of 11.3 oC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These reproductive preferences keep the two species separate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;An example of temporal isolation - or mating at different times - are the toad species Bufo americanus and Bufo fowleri. &amp;nbsp;These toads overlap in geographic range and when in a laboratory they will mate and produce fertile offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wild, however, Bufo americanus mates in the early summer while Bufo fowleri mates in late summer. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These differences in mating time keep the two species separate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;Behavioral differences between species can serve as reproductive isolating mechanisms. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Birds, fish, and mammals are well known for their elaborate courtship displays and mating calls. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many organisms also release chemicals known as pheromones - these pheromones are very specific and the pheromones of one species do not attract individuals of a different species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;This series of pictures shows the mating dance of the male blue footed booby - apparently she liked his dance!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 7&lt;br&gt;Mechanical isolation refers to males and females of different species being unable to mate because of mechanical incompatibility between their reproductive organs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is well documented in insects - insects have hard exoskeletons and their genitalia must fit together very precisely for mating to occur. &amp;nbsp;Differences in genital structure serve as a reproductive isolating mechanism between species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 8&lt;br&gt;Gamete incompatibility refers to crosses where no offspring are produced because the gametes are incompatible and fertilization does not occur. &amp;nbsp;This happens in many closely related species. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some species, the female reproductive tract is inhospitable - this has been observed in crosses between different species of fruit flies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marine invertebrates, like coral for example, have external fertilization - they release their sperm and eggs into the seawater and the gametes need to find each other. &amp;nbsp;They need to be compatible and of the same species for fertilization to take place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is also common in plants - the pollen from one species of plant cannot fertilize the ovules of a different species.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Genetics Selection and Speciation Part 3 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Genetics Selection and Speciation Part 3 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;In this tutorial - we are talking about speciation. &amp;nbsp;Speciation is the process of creating a new species. &amp;nbsp;But before we can talk about speciation - we need to talk about the definition of a species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many definitions of a species - we will talk about three examples: the morphological species concept, the evolutionary species concept, and the Biological species concept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;The morphological species concept states that a species is a group of individuals with shared morphologies or appearances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This definition makes sense - it is probably no surprise to learn that the Blackburnian warbler is a distinct and separate species from the Chestnut-sided warbler. &amp;nbsp;They look different from each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;This definition does not always work, however, &amp;nbsp;For a long time it was thought that these two parrots are from different species because they look so different from each other. &amp;nbsp;In fact, they are the male and female of the same species - sexual dimorphism can make the morphological species concept difficult to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, look at these ants - they look very different from each other. &amp;nbsp;But in fact they are sisters - ants are an example of what are known as eusocial insects and each ant in the colony has a very specific role or job. &amp;nbsp;Even genetically very similar individuals can look quite different depending upon their job. &amp;nbsp;Again, the morphological species concept is difficult to use with these ants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;The morphological species concept is also difficult to use when different species look very similar. &amp;nbsp;This is the case with Eastern and Western Meadowlarks. &amp;nbsp;It is challenging for even a seasoned ornithologist to tell these species apart by simply looking at them. &amp;nbsp;They are, however, considered distinct species because they have very different songs and do not usually mate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;The Evolutionary species concept groups organisms together based on shared evolutionary history. &amp;nbsp;This can be a useful definition but it also has limitations - specifically because we usually do not know the full evolutionary history of a species.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;The Biological Species Concept is the definition that is used the most by biologists. &amp;nbsp;It describes a species as a group of potentially interbreeding individuals that can produce fertile offspring. &amp;nbsp;The limitations of this definition is that it cannot be used to describe asexual and extinct species. &amp;nbsp;Also, sometimes different species do interbreed and produce hybrids - often, however, these hybrids are not fertile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An example of this is a mating between a horse and donkey to produce a mule. &amp;nbsp;Horses and donkeys are considered distinct species because mules are sterile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 7&lt;br&gt;Regardless of the definition that is used to define a species - we know that the number of species has been steadily increasing since the evolution of life on earth. &amp;nbsp;While there have been periods of mass extinction - such as at the end of the Cretaceous 65 million years ago. &amp;nbsp;It is not the biggest extinction but it is the most famous because it ended the age of dinosaurs and made way for mammals and birds. &amp;nbsp;During this event, 50% of the known genera (a genus is a level of organization just above a species) - went extinct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these mass extinctions, the number of different types of organisms has been increasing. &amp;nbsp;Some biologists estimate that there may be 150 million different species on earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 8&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The definition that is used to define a species has more than just biological implications. &amp;nbsp;It can have politcal implications as well. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the Endangered Species Act is some of the strongest environmental legislation that exists in the United States. &amp;nbsp;This legislation was enacted to save species from going extinct as a result of human activity. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The endangered species act uses the Biological Species Concept to define a species. &amp;nbsp;This has implications for organisms like the Red Wolf - Canis rufus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Red Wolf used to range through out the southeastern US (and even into central Pennsylvania) but it became extinct in the wild in 1980. &amp;nbsp;In 1987 it was reintroduced into North Carolina in efforts to reestablish a wild population. &amp;nbsp;These efforts have been successful but controversial. &amp;nbsp;Red wolves and gray wolves can interbreed and produce fertile offspring - so people have argued about the validity of giving the red wolf distinct species status. &amp;nbsp;The Fish and Wildlife Service considers the matter settled and supports the idea that the red wolf is a separate species from the gray wolf and deserves protection under the endangered species act.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Genetics Selection and Speciation Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Genetics Selection and Speciation Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;Natural selection tends to remove alleles from the population - this decreases genetic variation in the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balancing selection works to maintain deleterious/alternative alleles in a population&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Examples of balancing selection are Heterozygote advantage&lt;br&gt;and Frequency-dependent selection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;We have already discussed the idea of heterozygote advantage. &amp;nbsp;This refers to a situation where the heterozygotes have increased fitness when compared to either homozygous dominant or homozygous recessive indivdiuals. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An example of this is sickle cell trait - in an environment where malaria is present - the heterozygous individuals have increased resistance to malaria when compared to homozygous dominant individuals (homozygous recessive individuals have sickle cell disease).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please recognzie that this heterozygote advantage only occurs in places where malaria is common. &amp;nbsp;Heterozygotes do not have an advantage in the US where malaria is not a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;Frequency-dependent selection refers to a situation where the more common phenotype is selected against. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water boatmen are aquatic insects that occur in three color morphs - dark brown, medium brown, and light brown. &amp;nbsp;Fish like to eat water boatmen and they tend to develop a search preference. &amp;nbsp;When the dark brown form is most abundant - fish tend to eat the dark brown form. &amp;nbsp;This causes the dark brown form to become less common and one of the other color morphs becomes most abundant (let's say light brown for example). &amp;nbsp;Now the light brown becomes the fish's favorite form and the light brown becomes selected against. &amp;nbsp;The result is that the abundance of the three forms changes consistently in response to fish predation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;Another form of selection is sexual selection. &amp;nbsp;Sexual selection describes the selection of a mate based on a specific heritable trait.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not a mode of natural selection because natural selection increases the adaptation of a population to a specific set of environmental conditions whereas sexual selection does not&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selection is typically for a secondary sexual characteristic - something like coloration or behavior. &amp;nbsp;And this type of selection often results in sexual dimorphism - when males and females look different from&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;Sexual selection can take one of two main forms. &amp;nbsp;Either intersexual selection where males perform elaborate rituals, sing elaborate songs, build elaborate structures, or have elaborate appearances all in an attempt to attract a female. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An example of intersexual selection is bower birds where the male builds an elaborate bower to attract a female. &amp;nbsp;This is not a nest and it has no purpose other than to impress a female. &amp;nbsp;Females choose the male who builds the best bower. &amp;nbsp;Male bower birds are known to rob camp sites and garbage cans looking for brightly colored bits of plastic and metal to decorate their bowers. &amp;nbsp;In this image here, the male has decorated his bower with pieces of blue plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;Intrasexual selection is when a male competes with another male for access to females. &amp;nbsp;This type of system usually evolves when all of the females live in a centralized location and a dominant male can fight to maintain access to them. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An example of this is the elephant seal - male seals fight for access to a group of females. &amp;nbsp;The winner will get to mate with all of the females while the loser gets no mating opportunities (unless of course, he can sneak in while the dominant male is not looking).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the stakes are so high - competitions between male seals can become quite violent. &amp;nbsp;Once a male wins - he has to work hard to maintain his position. &amp;nbsp;Dominant male elephant seals will often go months without feeding because to do so would mean leaving his females unguarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 7&lt;br&gt;In many species, sexual selection results in sexual dimorphism (a difference in appearance between males and females)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sexual dimorphism is often most noticeable in birds - males usually have bright colors and females are often more drab. &amp;nbsp;However, it does occur in other species such as some mammals, fish, reptiles and lizards.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Genetics Selection and Speciation Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;In this tutorial we are discussing the different modes of natural selection. &amp;nbsp;Recall that natural selection is best defined as differential reproduction - which we now know means that those individuals with greater fitness pass on more copies of their genes to the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This results in an adaptive allele frequency change within the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember that natural selection requires variation in the population - the trait that is being selected for must be heritable and must contribute to an increase in fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;A classic example of natural selection in action is the pepper moth and industrial melanism. &amp;nbsp;Melanin in the pigment that results in dark coloration in the moth and other organisms, &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two forms of the moth: one mottled (light-colored) and one black. In natural conditions, the mottled phenotype is more common because it mimics lichen on trees and thus birds tend to prey on the black moth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see on this image that in the light colored background the light colored moth is hard to see. &amp;nbsp;In a dark colored background, the dark colored moth is difficult to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;During the Industrial Revolution, soot from factories darkened the trees and poor air quality destroyed the lichen. This resulted in a shift of the phenotype frequency curve because the mottled phenotype became more visible to predators, and thus became the prey of choice for birds. &amp;nbsp;The environment selected for dark colored moths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This graphic shows what happened to the frequency of dark colored moths in the population after clean air regulations were enacted. &amp;nbsp;Better air quality allowed the lichens to recolonize the tree trunks and the moths environment became predominantly light colored again. &amp;nbsp;Once again, the environment favored light colored moths and the percentage of dark colored moths has decreased significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;Natural selection results in adpative change in populations. &amp;nbsp;But how is this change noticed? &amp;nbsp;By observing the changes that take place the distribution of the phenotype in the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can describe the type of selection that is happening by observing these changes in the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The types of selection are: Stabilizing Selection,&lt;br&gt;Directional Selection, Diversifying Selection, Balancing Selection, and Sexual Selection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;To discuss this issue we will think about traits that are distributed around a median phenotype. &amp;nbsp;In the original population the phenotype is distributed in a normal distribution or a bell curve. &amp;nbsp;The different types of selectoin affect which part of the distribution is selected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;Stabilizing selection occurs in stable environments where there is very little change occuring in the environment. &amp;nbsp;in this type of selection the mean phenotype is selected for while the extreme phenotypes are selected against. &amp;nbsp;This culls out variants and results in a population with a more limited range of phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 7&lt;br&gt;A nice example of stabilizing selection is birth weight in humans. &amp;nbsp;The birth weight of nearly 7000 human female babies were recorded in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After one month, survival of these babies was determined as a function of birth weight&lt;br&gt;Overall survival was 95.9%&lt;br&gt;-Babies less than 4.5 lb had 41.4% survival&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;-babies 7.5 -8.5 lb had 98.5 survival&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;-Babies greater than 10.0 lb had 90.5% survival&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babies that are born too small or too large are selected against and babies between 7.5 and 8.5 pounds are selected for. &amp;nbsp;This is an example of stabilizing selection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 8&lt;br&gt;Directional selection is common in environments that are changing and an extreme phenotype is selected for. &amp;nbsp;We have already learned about the Galapagose finches evolving a thicker, stronger beak in response to a drought and the peppered moth evolving to a darker color morph in response to a darkening of their environment. &amp;nbsp;These are examples of directional selection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 9&lt;br&gt;In Diversifying (also referred to as disruptive) selection both extremes are selected for and the mean phenotype is selected against. &amp;nbsp;This results in a bimodal distribution in the population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 10&lt;br&gt;An amusing example of disruptive selection can be seen in the Horned Dung beetles of Australia. &amp;nbsp;In this species, male dung beetles have either large horns or no horns. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Males with large horns guard the tunnels in which female beetles lay eggs. &amp;nbsp;Mate with females and keep other males away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Males with no horns dig side tunnels to sneak into the female tunnels, bypass guarding males and mate with females&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Males with intermediate horns would not be as good at guarding tunnels, and would not be as good at sneaking matings. &amp;nbsp;The result is there are two male phenotypes - large horns or no horns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Population Genetics Part 5 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Population Genetics Part 5 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;Gene flow is another factor that can cause evolution in a population. &amp;nbsp;Gene flow refers to the movement of individuals into and out of a population. &amp;nbsp;Gene flow is essentially immigration and emigration. &amp;nbsp;As individuals move from one population to another - they take their alleles with them and have the ability to change allele frequencies. &amp;nbsp;In this graphic, a population of beetles that is predominantly green experiences immigration from a population that is predominantly brown. &amp;nbsp;The result is that the population experiences an increase in the frequency of the brown alleles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;A mutation refers to a change in an organisms DNA. &amp;nbsp;Mutation is a normal process - when a DNA molecule is making a copy of itself - it is possible for mistakes to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These mistakes or mutations are the raw material for evolution - because mutations create new alleles. &amp;nbsp;Think back to the example of eye color in fruit flies. &amp;nbsp;The wild-type allele results in red eyes. &amp;nbsp;A mutation occurred in the gene for eye color and the result is that inviduals who inherited that new allele have white eyes. &amp;nbsp;Mutation has created genetic variation for natural selection to act upon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While mutations are an important evolutionary factor - many mutations have little effect on allele frequencies. &amp;nbsp;Why is this? &amp;nbsp;Because most mutations are bad for the organism - many mutations result in death of the organism and dead organisms cannot pass on their genes. &amp;nbsp;Therefore the new allele does not get established in the population. &amp;nbsp;However, every now and then a mutation is beneficial - and the organism that has the mutation benefits. &amp;nbsp;In this case the mutation can get established in the population and affect allele frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, to be passed to the new generation the mutation most occur in germ cells (or sperm and eggs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;As an example of a mutation, we can look at the allele that causes sickle cell disease. &amp;nbsp;The allele that causes the disease is the result of a single base pair substition in the DNA. &amp;nbsp;The normal allele has a single base pair different from the disease allele (in all we have 3 billion base pairs that make up our DNA so a single base pair changes is incredibly small but can have a huge impact on the person's phenotype). &amp;nbsp;We can see this single base pair change here - the normal DNA has a T in this position while the mutated DNA has an A. &amp;nbsp;The result is a single amino acid change in the hemoglobin protein - a glutamic acid in the normal protein and a valine in the mutated protein. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;Mutations are happening all the time as the result of exposure to DNA mutating agents - such as chemicals in the environment (both natural and synthetic) and radiation. &amp;nbsp;For example, sunlight (specifically UVB rays) cause a specific type of mutation known as a thymine dimer which can lead to skin cancer. &amp;nbsp;Luckily, we also have DNA repair enzymes that can fix some mistakes - occasionally, however, the damage overwhelms these systems and cancer can result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;Non-random mating is the norm in populations. &amp;nbsp;This means that there is some sort of mate selection occuring. &amp;nbsp;In the example on this screen, The brown beetle on the left is exhibiting random mating - he is equally likely to mate with any of the other color beetles. &amp;nbsp;The beetle on the right, however, is exhibiting nonrandom mating - he only wants to mate with other brown beetles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans exhibit non-random mating - people of the same cultural, educational and socioeconomic backgrounds tend to partner more than people of different backgrounds do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-random mating changes genotype frequencies but not allele frequencies because it does not introduce new alleles to a population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;Our final factor in evolutionary change is one that we have already talked about - natural selection. &amp;nbsp;Natural selection should have a big star next to it in your notes - because it is the only factor in evolution that results in a population becoming better adapted to its environment than previous generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this population of beetles there are two color morphs - green and brown. &amp;nbsp;A new species of bird moves into the environment - and it tends to eat the green beetles because&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;they are easier for it to see. &amp;nbsp;As a result, the brown allele increases in frequency in the population and the population becomes predominantly brown. &amp;nbsp;This population is now better adapted to its environment because most of the individuals in the population are hard for the predator to see. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 7&lt;br&gt;Remember that our most concise definition of natural selection is differential reproduction. &amp;nbsp;Those individuals that are better adapted to their environment leave more offspring. &amp;nbsp;The number of offspring an individual leaves is a measure of its fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If different genotypes have differing fitness - the more fit genotypes will become more common. &amp;nbsp;In our beetle example, the brown beetles were more likely to survive and reproduce and thus the genotype associated with brown color became more common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 8&lt;br&gt;Fitness is an indicator of reproductive success - the individual that leaves the most offspring has the highest biological fitness. &amp;nbsp;There is a distinction between survivorship and reproductive success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An individual can die young but be fit - by having a large number of offspring. &amp;nbsp;Or an individual can die old but lack fitness - by not leaving any offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparisons of fitness can only be made within populations. &amp;nbsp;You cannot compare the fitness of an elephant with the fitness of a mayfly. &amp;nbsp;A female elephant, for example, does not become reproductive until age 13. She can live to be 70 but typically has 5-6 babies during her life. &amp;nbsp;A mayfly by comparison lives minutes to days depending on the species but in that time can have hundreds of offspring. &amp;nbsp;It would not be biologically meaningful to compare the fitness of an elephant with the fitness of a mayfly!&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Population Genetics Part 4 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Population Genetics Part 4 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the previous tutorial we used the Hardy-Weinberg equation to determine expected allele and genotype frequencies in a population at a given time. The definition of evolution is a change in allele and genotype frequencies, or a change in the gene pool of a population. WHen population is not changing or not evolving it is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Biologists have determined 5 factors that maintain Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in a population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These 5 factors are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No mutation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No gene flow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No genetic drift&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Random mating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No natural selection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that the opposite five factors will result in evolutionary change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic drift&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gene flow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mutation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonrandom mating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural selection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These five factors are known as the agents of evolutionary change. They cause populations to evolve. We will now talk a little bit about each of these factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recognize two basic levels of evolution. Macroevolution refers to evolutionary changes that mark the appearance of a new species or a new genus or a higher level of biological classification. For example, birds evolving from a dinosaur ancestors is a example of macroevolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microevolution, on the other hand, refers to evolutionary changes that lead to alterations of allele and genotype frequencies within a populations. In this tutorial we are focusing on microevolution changes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic drift is a phenomena of small populations. Please note genetic drift and gene flow which we will be talking about later, are two separate phenomena. People often confuse them. Genetic drift refers to the random fluctuations in allele and genotype frequencies that occur in populations because they are small.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This image illustrates the impact of genetic drift on a small population. On the left side of the diagram is a large population of penguins. Individuals in red carry the allele that we are monitoring. On the right side of the diagram is a small population of penguins with the carriers once again in red. If 50% of each population dies, the large population does not experience dramatic change in allele frequency. The frequency of the allele goes from 10% to 9% which is a rather small change considering the dramatic decrease in size the population has experienced. In the small population however, the loss of 50% of the population has a much greater impact on the allele frequency. By change the single carrier of the allele was lost in the population decline and the frequency of the allele has gone to zero. Small populations experience changes in allele and genotype frequencies more dramatically than large populations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two examples of how a population can become small so that genetic drift is a factor. These are the founder effect and the bottleneck effect.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 7&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bottleneck effect occurs when a catastrophe decimates a large population and the population becomes small. Northern elephant seals have reduced genetic variation because of a population bottleneck humans inflicted on them in the 1890s. Extreme hunting pressure reduced their population size to as few as 20 individuals at the end of the 19th century. Their population has since rebounded to over 30,000 individuals but their genes still carry the marks of this bottleneck. They have much less genetic variation than a population of southern elephant seals that was not so intensely hunted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The founder effect refers to the loss of genetic information when a new colony is formed by a very small number of individuals from a larger population. The old order Amish of Pennsylvania are an example of a population that has experienced a founder effect. Because of their closed population&amp;nbsp; stemming from a small number of German immigrants, about 200 individuals, the Amish carry unusual concentrations of gene mutations that cause a number of otherwise rare inherited disorders. Including forms of dwarfism such as Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, seen here. Polydactyly, the presence of extra fingers or toes is an other aspect of this condition &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Population Genetics Part 3 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Population Genetics Part 3 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;Ok - let's work through the solutions to these problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this question, you are given the frequency of the dominant allele (p = .3) and the frequency of the recessive allele (q = .7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are asked to determine the frequency of carriers in this population. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;Remember, carriers are heterozygotes and to determine the frequency of heterozygotes you always need to multiply by 2. &amp;nbsp;Thus we see that in this population, the frequency of carriers is .42 or 42%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;This question asks you to determine an allele frequency when you are given a genotype frequency. &amp;nbsp;When you are presented with a Hardy-Weinberg question - I suggest you take the time to figure out what information you have been given. &amp;nbsp;In this question you are told that 81% of the people in Smallville USA have a smooth chin. &amp;nbsp;Having a smooth chin is an expression of a person's genotype - and having a smooth chin is the recessive condition. &amp;nbsp;That means that q^2 =81% or .81.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;Remember, q^2 is the frequency of homozygous recessive individuals in the population and anyone with a smooth chin is homozygous recessive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;If q^2 equals .81, we can then solve for q by taking the square root of .81 - which equals .9. &amp;nbsp;If q = .9, then p=.1 or 10% (p is the frequency of the dominant cleft chin allele.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the answer is A - 10%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;Now we will do some sample problems looking at a gene with three alleles - and we will use the ABO blood group as our example. &amp;nbsp;The ABO blood group gene has three alleles - the A allele, the B allele, and the O allele. &amp;nbsp;Given these three alleles - what are the possible genotypes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 7&lt;br&gt;There are 6 different possible genotypes - remember that in this gene the A and B allele are both dominant to the O allele and A and B are codominant to each other. &amp;nbsp;So while there are 6 different genotypes there are only four different phenotypes - type A blood, type B blood, type AB blood and type O blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 8&lt;br&gt;To apply this blood group gene to the Hardy-Weinberg equation we can standardize the notations so that p, q, and r &amp;nbsp;are the A allele, B allele, and O allele respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genotype frequencies are p^2 + 2pq + q^2 + r^2 + 2pr + 2qr and they correlate to the blood group genotypes: IAIA + IAIB + IBIB + ii + IAi + IBi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 9&lt;br&gt;This question asks you to apply your understanding of the ABO blood group to the Hardy-Weinberg variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 10&lt;br&gt;The answer is E - Both A and B. &amp;nbsp;This is because p^2 refers to the homozygous A genotype and 2pr refers to the heterozygous A and O genotype. &amp;nbsp;Both genotypes result in Type A blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 11&lt;br&gt;So now we are ready to answer a question about the frequency of the B allele in a population. &amp;nbsp;We are told that in this population, the frequency of the A allele is .3 and the frequency of people with Type O blood is 36.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 12&lt;br&gt;Again, it is helpful to take the time to write out what is known about the population. &amp;nbsp;We know that the A allele is .3 - this is p. &amp;nbsp;We also know that the frequency of people with type O blood is .36 - this is the homozygous recessive genotype or r^2. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From r^2 we can solve for r which equals .6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given these numbers, we can now determine that the frequency of the B allele is .1.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 13&lt;br&gt;Now you are asked to determine the frequency of people with Type B blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 14&lt;br&gt;You can use the calculations you did for the previous question and recognize that there are two ways to have Type B blood - either genotype homozygous B which corresponds to q^2 or heterozygous for B and O which corresponds to 2qr. &amp;nbsp;In this population, 13% of the people are expected to have Type B blood.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Population Genetics Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Population Genetics Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;So far, we have dealt with the behavior of genes between generations and focused on the phenotypes of individuals. Next we'll take a broader look at genetics and see how the genetics of populations are studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Population genetics is the field of biology that studies the genetic composition of populations, and the changes in genetic composition that result from the operation of various evolutionary factors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;Population geneticists study populations. &amp;nbsp;Populations are groups of individuals of the same species that live in the same geographic area or range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When population geneticists study a population - they study the gene pool of the population. &amp;nbsp;The gene pool is the sum of the alleles present in a population at a particular time. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Populations can vary in the amount of genetic variation (and thus alleles) that is found in the population. &amp;nbsp;For example, at the Penn State - University Park campus - the population of gray squirrels is monomorphic for fur color and are all gray while the squirrels on the Kent State campus are polymorphic - there are gray and black squirrels. &amp;nbsp;This means there is more genetic variation in the Kent State population with respect to coat color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;Population geneticists have a tool that allows them to keep track of allele and genotype frequencies in a population (it is similar to the Punneqq square tool the geneticists use to analyze crosses between individuals).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tool is known as the Hardy-Weinberg equation and it has two components. &amp;nbsp;The first is the equation that sums allele frequencies (we will start by looking at a gene with two alleles).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a gene with two alleles - we will indicate one allele as p (this is typically the dominant allele) and the other allele as q (this is typically the recessive allele). &amp;nbsp;For a gene with just these two alleles - the frequency of these alleles must sum to 1. &amp;nbsp;So p + q = 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a gene with two alleles there are three possible genotypes - homozygous dominant, heterozygous, and homozygous recessive. &amp;nbsp;The frequency of the homozygous dominant individuals is p^2, the frequency of the heterozygous individuals is 2pq, and the frequency of the homozygous recessive individuals is q^2. &amp;nbsp;These indivdiual&lt;br&gt;frequencies must sum to 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;We can look at an example using a hypothetical gene A in which the frequency of the dominant allele is .2 and the frequency of the recessive allele is .8. &amp;nbsp;We can also visualize the Hardy-Weinberg equation by using a Punnett Square - in this example we are using a Punnett square to visualize a potential cross between all individuals in the population so we must include the allele frequencies along with the alleles along the axes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we fill out the Punnett square we see the frequency of homozygous dominant individuals is .04, the frequency of heterozygotes is .32 (using the 2pq part of the equation). &amp;nbsp;The frequency of homozygous recessive individuals is .64. &amp;nbsp;The sum of .04 and .32 and .64 is 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the absence of outside factors, the frequencies of gametes, genotypes, and phenotypes stay the same from one generation to the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Population geneticists use this tool to watch for changes in allele and genotype frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;As you have learned earlier, some genes have more than two alleles. &amp;nbsp;So we can take a more complicated look at population genetics and the Hardy-Weinberg equation by looking at an example of a gene with three alleles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, in a three allele situation, we use the letters p, q, and r to describe the three alleles. &amp;nbsp;The genotype frequencies are derived from multiplying (p+q+r) times (p+q+r). &amp;nbsp;This gives genotype frequencies of p^2 + 2pq + q^2 + r^2 + 2pr + 2qr.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;Remember that our definition of evolution is a change in the genetic structure of a population. &amp;nbsp;This means a change in allele and genotype frequencies. &amp;nbsp;The Hardy-Weinberg equation is a tool that allows us to monitor changes in allele and genotype frequencies and thus observe evolution occuring in populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When allele and genotype frequencies change in populations - we refer to the population as moving out of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. &amp;nbsp;It is the forces of evolution - such as natural selection - that move a population out of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Gene to Protein Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;The second stage of protein synthesis is translation. &amp;nbsp;This is the stage where the genetic information in the messenger RNA molecule is used to produce a polypeptide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process takes place in the cytoplasm at structures known as ribosomes. &amp;nbsp;Ribosomes help to build the protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Translation requires raw materials. &amp;nbsp;The process requires the molecule of messener RNA to provide the instructions for building the protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It requires a molecule of tRNA or transfer RNA to carry the amino acids to the ribosome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And translation requires a supply of amino acids - the building blocks of proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;The process of translation requires a language change - that is why this stage of protein synthesis is known as translation. &amp;nbsp;The cell is using information in the language of DNA and RNA to create a protein. &amp;nbsp;DNA and RNA are nucleic acids whose language is built on the five nucleotides - A, G, C, T, and U. &amp;nbsp;Proteins are in the language of the twenty different amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic code serves as the translator between these two languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic code is a triplet code - it uses a sequence of three nucleotides (known as a codon) to code for an amino acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Genetic Code is redundant - more than one codon specifies the same amino acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Genetic code is unambiguous - each codon species only one AA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also universal - virtually the same across all organisms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has specific signals to specify the start and stop of a polypeptide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;This is the genetic code from the tutorial and it is the version we will use for the course. &amp;nbsp;Let's look at some of the features of the genetic code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start - the genetic code is written in the language of mRNA. And this version of the code orients you to the polarity of the mRNA molecule - the first base is the 5' end of the mRNA molecule and the third base is the 3' end.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a triplet code. &amp;nbsp;For example, the mRNA codon UUU codes for the amino acid phenylalanine. &amp;nbsp;And it is unambigous - UUU codes for phenylalanine and only phenylalanine. &amp;nbsp;But there is also redundancy - because the codon UUC also codes for phenylalanine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is one start codon - this is the codon AUG - which There is one start codon - ANUG - and it codes for the amino acid methionine. &amp;nbsp;This means that all proteins start with the amino acid methionine (the mature protein may have the methionine removed but at least initially all proteins start with methionine). &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are 3 stop codons - UAA, UAG, and UGA. &amp;nbsp;They do not code for an amino acid and instead signal the end of a protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;The molecule that is responsible for translating between the language of RNA and the language of protein is transfer RNA - also known as tRNA. &amp;nbsp;We can focus on the simplified view of the tRNA molecule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two regions of the molecule that are important - the anticodon region and the amino acid attachment site. &amp;nbsp;The anticodon region is a sequenc of 3 RNA nucleotides that are complimentary to a codon in the mRNA. &amp;nbsp;The anticodon determines the amino acid that will attach to the amino acid attachment site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;For example, the mRNA codon 5' CCU 3' - codes for the amino acid Proline. &amp;nbsp;The tRNA molecule that will carry the amino acid proline will have the anticodon of 3' GGA 5' (remember, nucleic acid pairings have to follow the base pairing rules as well as the polarity rules). &amp;nbsp;The tRNA with an anticodon sequence of 3'GGA 5' will carry the amino acid proline at its amino acid attachment site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;In this way, tRNA is the molecular translator that translates the genetic information in a messenger RNA molecule into the language of protein.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process occurs at the ribosome. &amp;nbsp;In this image, we see a ribosome in blue - it is made up of two subunits - the small ribosomal subunit and the large ribosomal subunit. &amp;nbsp;These two subunits come together and sandwhich the mRNA molecule. &amp;nbsp;While the mRNA molecule is held between the two subunits - the tRNA molecules carry the appropriate amino acids to the ribosome to create the protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The codons in the mRNA provide the instructions and the tRNA essentially follows the instructions and adds the correct amino acid to the growing protein until a stop codon is reached. &amp;nbsp;Once the stop codon is reached - the ribosome separates and the protein has been made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 7&lt;br&gt;The following slides are practice problems using the genetic code. &amp;nbsp;When you have answered these questions - access the next Voice Thread to see the solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;DNA Replication Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;This question is asking you to orient yourself to the polarities of the two strands of the DNA molecule. &amp;nbsp;The easiest way to approach this problem is to look for the DNA polymerase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;The DNA polymerase is always at the 3' end of the newly synthesized DNA. &amp;nbsp;Each piece of nucleic acid has a 3' and a 5' end - note that there are several molecules of DNA polymerase found on this diagram so we can orient ourselves in several different places. &amp;nbsp;The opposite end of the strand is the 5' end and the 3'end of one strand must align with the 5' end of another strand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;This question requires you to use both the polarity rules and the base-pairing rules. &amp;nbsp;First, we have to align the 5' end of the given strand with the 3' end of its complimentary strand. &amp;nbsp;Then we need to use the base-pairing rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;Using the polarity and base-pairing rules we see that A is the correct answer. &amp;nbsp;The 5' end of the given strand aligns with the 3' end of the A strand. &amp;nbsp;Then we see that A base pairs with T, C with G, A with T, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;This question is similar to the previous question but now the possible answers are written 5' to 3'. &amp;nbsp;Remember, DNA molecules are 3-dimensional and can be oriented in any way. &amp;nbsp;However, when they physically connect to each other they need to be paired 5' to 3' and 3' to 5'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So to answer this question you need to align the 5' end of the given strand with the 3' end of the complimentary strand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;The correct answer to this question is B. &amp;nbsp;When you align the 5' end of the given strand with the 3'end of the answer - you can then use the base-pairing rules to find the complimentary strand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please let me know if you have any questions about these practice problems.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>DNA Replication Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;DNA Replication Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;DNA replication is the process of replicating a chromosome - this occurs prior to cell division and is the process that creates the sister chromatids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;Recall from our discussions of mitosis and meiosis that before a cell divides it must make a copy of each chromosome. &amp;nbsp;In the image on this slide we see on the left the unreplicated chromosome and on the right the replicated chromosome comprised of two identical sister chromatids. &amp;nbsp;DNA replication is the process that creates the identical sister chromatids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;In order to understand the process of DNA replication, we must understand the structure of the DNA molecule. &amp;nbsp;As mentioned in the previous tutorial, a DNA molecule is double stranded molecule that is held togther by hydrogen bonds between nitrogenous bases of the two strands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;The hydrogen bonds between the two nitrogenous bases are specific and only form between an adenine and thymine and a guanine and cytosine - these are the DNA base pairing rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is another rule to the way the two DNA strands pair. &amp;nbsp;Each strand of DNA has a 5' end and a 3' end. &amp;nbsp;The 5' and 3' refer to the numbering of the carbons in the sugar molecule of the nucleotides. &amp;nbsp;The top nucleotide on the left of this image shows the numbering of the carbons. &amp;nbsp;On the strand on the left, the 5' carbon is oriented toward the 5' end of the molecule. &amp;nbsp;The 3' end of the molecule is oriented toward the 3' sugar. &amp;nbsp;The strand on the right has the opposite orientation - the 3' end is toward the top of the molecule and the 5' end is toward the bottom. &amp;nbsp;Whenever nucleic acids base pair together - the 3' end of one strand must be aligned with the 5' end of the other. &amp;nbsp;This rule will be very important when we discuss both DNA replication and protein synthesis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;The process of DNA replication takes place within the nucleus (the DNA in our cells is mainly in the nucleus). &amp;nbsp;In order for a cell to build a new molecule of DNA it needs some raw materials. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, there needs to be a template or original molecule of DNA. &amp;nbsp;During DNA replication, both strands of DNA are copied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There also needs to be a supply of nucleotides to build the new DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, there needs to be enzymes to actually do the job of building the molecule. &amp;nbsp;Enzymes are proteins that perform jobs within cells. &amp;nbsp;The enzymes that do the job of replicating DNA are helicase, primase, DNA polymerase, and Ligase. &amp;nbsp;We can tell by the names that these are all enzymes because they all end in the suffix "ase". &amp;nbsp;Most enzymes are named this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DNA polymerase is the enzyme that actually builds the DNA polymer. &amp;nbsp;It has one very important limitation - it can only add nucleotides to the 3' end of the newly synthesized DNA strand. &amp;nbsp;We will see why this is important shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;This image shows most of the details about DNA replication. &amp;nbsp;Note that this image shows the overall direction of replication - this means that parental DNA molecule is unwinding from right to left. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the DNA can be replicated - the two strands must unwind and separate from each other. &amp;nbsp;It is the job of helicase to unwind the parental strands and proteins known as single-strand binding proteins anchor the two strands so they cannot reattach to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 7&lt;br&gt;To begin replication, the process must be primed. &amp;nbsp;This means that an existing piece of nucleic acid must be placed along the original DNA to start the process of replication. &amp;nbsp;The enzyme primase is responsible for priming the process. &amp;nbsp;It places a small RNA primer along the original DNA. &amp;nbsp;Each strand is being copies so each strand requires primers. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason the process requires a primer is because DNA polymerase cannot start producing new DNA from scratch. &amp;nbsp;DNA polymerase can only add to an existing piece of nucleic acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 8&lt;br&gt;DNA polymerase adds nucleotides to the 3' end of the newly placed primer and continues to add nucleotides until the entire molecule has been replicated. &amp;nbsp;Each strand is replicated so DNA polymerase is working along each strand. &amp;nbsp;Because the two DNA strands are antiparallel DNA polymerase cannot add continously along both strands. &amp;nbsp;Along the top strand - referred to as the leading strand, the newly synthesized DNA is oriented in the 5' to 3' direction. &amp;nbsp;So DNA polymerase can happily go along adding nucleotides in the direction of replication in a continous fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along the bottom strand - known as the lagging strand, DNA polymerase has to work opposite to the overall direction of replication. &amp;nbsp;This is because DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to the 3' end of the new DNA. &amp;nbsp;The result is that along the lagging strand DNA gets produced in discontinous fragments known as Okazaki fragments. &amp;nbsp;Each fragment requires its own primer so primase has to work multiple times along the lagging strand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 9&lt;br&gt;The final enzyme to work is ligase. &amp;nbsp;Its job is to connect the Okazaki fragments together into one seamless piece of DNA. &amp;nbsp;First the RNA primers are removed and then the fragments are sealed together. &amp;nbsp;The result is that at the end of DNA replication - an entire chromosome has been copied to create an identical sister chromatid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 10&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The next three slides are practice problems. &amp;nbsp;Work them through and then access the next Voice Thread to see the solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Chromosome Behavior and Gene Linkage Part 4 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Chromosome Behavior and Gene Linkage Part 4 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;Let's work through these problems to help prepare you for the quiz and exam questions you will see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This question can best be answered by writing out the genotypes of the parents and then creating a Punnett square.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;The heterozygous parent can make four different gamete types and the homozygous parent makes one gamete type. &amp;nbsp;If the offspring occur in a 1:1:1:1 ratio - the genes are not linked and they assort independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;If the genes are assorting independently, the genes are not linked and they may or may not be on the same chromosome. &amp;nbsp;Remember for genes to be linked they have to be on the same chromosome AND closer than 50 map units. &amp;nbsp;So unlinked genes can either be on different chromosomes or on the same chromosome but further than 50 map units apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;To answer this question - you need to write out the genotypes of the parents and think about the way the genes are linked. &amp;nbsp;To be completely linked means that they are so close together on the chromosome they crossing over never recombines them - so they stay together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;The original parents are CCdd and ccDD so this means parent 1 has chromosomes with alleles C and d and parent two has chromosomes with alleles c and D. &amp;nbsp;Each parent can only make one gamete type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their offspring will all have the genotype CcDd - but you need to pay attention to the arrangement of alleles - because the genes are completely linked C stays with d and c stays with D - no crossing over occurs. &amp;nbsp;When one of these offspring is crossed with a homozygous recessive individual - there are only two possible offspring that can result - Ccdd or ccDd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;So the answer to this question is B - two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 7&lt;br&gt;This question asks you to determine the distance between the genes for bristle structure and body color. &amp;nbsp;The first thing you need to determine is which offspring are the recombinants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 8&lt;br&gt;Remember, recombinant means the offspring that were created as a result of a crossover between the two genes. &amp;nbsp;By definition, the recombinants are the two smallest categories of offspring and the parentals are the two largest categories of offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 9&lt;br&gt;So the offspring with wildtype bristles, wildtype body and with scute bristles, ebony body are the recombinants. &amp;nbsp;This means that the parental arrangement of alleles is s+ eb and s eb+. &amp;nbsp;Crossing over created the s+ eb+ and s eb gametes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 10&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the answer to this question is B - 38 map units. &amp;nbsp;192 + 188 = 380/1000 x 100 = 38% recombination or 38 map units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 11&lt;br&gt;This question asks you to determine the percent of gametes the female parent made that have the genotype m eb+. &amp;nbsp;To answer this question - draw out the females chromosomes and subsequent gametes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 12&lt;br&gt;You know that the female is heterozygous - but you do not know the specific arrangement of alleles on her chromosomes until you look at her offspring. &amp;nbsp;She can either have both wild-type alleles on one chromosome and both mutants on the other OR she can have one wild-type and one mutant on one chromosome and the other combination of mutant and wild-type on the other chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You determine her arrangement by looking at the offspring and determining the parental arrangement. &amp;nbsp;In this example, the Wild type eye color, wild type body color and the mahogany eyes, ebony body are the parental offspring. &amp;nbsp;Therefore, arrangement one is her arrangement of alleles. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her gametes that are m eb+ resulted in offspring that have the phenotype mahogany eyes and wild-type body. &amp;nbsp;This category has 176 offspring out of a total of 1000 offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 13&lt;br&gt;Therefore the answer is A - 17.6%. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have questions about any of these practice problems - please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Chromosome Behavior and Gene Linkage Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Chromosome Behavior and Gene Linkage Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;To further examine the idea of linked genes, we are going to examine a dihybrid cross the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. &amp;nbsp;Fruit flies are common study organisms in genetics laboratories and much of what we know about genetics we owe to the fruit fly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;Before we look at one of these crosses, we should review Drosophila nomenclature (you were introduced to this information in the previous tutorial).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Drosophila, genes are named after the first mutation that is discovered. &amp;nbsp;For example, normal fruit flies have red eyes (so we say red eyes are the wild-type trait). &amp;nbsp;The first eye color mutation that was found was white eyes. &amp;nbsp;So white eyes are the mutant phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the mutation is recessive, as is the case with the allele for white eyes, gene is symbolized with a lowercase letter - in this example, little w.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wild-type allele is always indicated with a plus sign - so in this example w+ is the wild-type allele and w is the mutant allele.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;This particular dihybrid cross includes the genes for body color (wild-type is gray and the mutant is black) and wing size (wild-type is normal and the mutant trait is vestigial wings - vestigial wings are small non-functional wings).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the fruit fly crosses in this unit on linked genes will be set up exactly the same way - a female who is heterozygous for both genes (so she is wild-type body color, wild-type wing size) is crossed with a homozygous recessive male. &amp;nbsp;You can see the genotypes of the parents here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the moment, assume that these genes are not linked and they assort independently. &amp;nbsp;If this is the case - what gametes can these parents make?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;If the genes are not linked, the heterozygous female can make four different gamete types in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. &amp;nbsp;The male is homozygous recessive so he can only make single gamete type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's take this assumption to the next step and predict the offspring that will result from this cross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;A Punnett square can help us visualize the offspring - along the top axis are the female's gametes and along the side is the male's single gamete type. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This cross can produce four types of offspring - in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. &amp;nbsp;Remember, we are assuming that the genes are not linked and they assort independently during meiosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;If we look again at the image from this tutorial, we see these four categories of offspring. &amp;nbsp;If the genes are not linked and they assort independently - then we expect these four categories of offspring to occur in approximately equal numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we observe something significantly different from a 1:1:1:1 ratio - then we know that our assumption was incorrect and the genes do not assort independently and are linked. &amp;nbsp;This cross allowed us to determine that the gene for body color and wing size are linked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 7&lt;br&gt;Remember, linked genes are on the same chromosome and closer than 50 map units apart. &amp;nbsp;Because they are on the same chromosome, they cannot assort independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These crosses can be used to determine more than whether or not two genes are linked. &amp;nbsp;We can also use these crosses to determine the distance between the two genes so that we can ultimately create a genetic map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 8&lt;br&gt;Remember, linked genes can recombine into new combinations as a result of crossing over. &amp;nbsp;The recombination frequency of linked genes provides information about the distance between two genes. &amp;nbsp;We can set up crosses that allow us to determine recombination frequencies and thus distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 9&lt;br&gt;Here is another view of our previous cross if a heterozygous female and a homozygous recessive male. &amp;nbsp;This image adds details about how the alleles are arranged on the chromosomes. &amp;nbsp;In this particular female, the two wild-type alleles are found on one chromosome and the two mutant alleles are found on its homologous partner. &amp;nbsp;During meiosis, crossing over recombines the alleles on two of the non-sister chromatids to create a a chromatid with the genotype b+ vg and a chromatid with the genotype b vg+. &amp;nbsp;Meiosis II separates the sister chromatids into individual gametes and we see the four different gamete types - b+ vg, b+ vg+, b vg+, and b vg. &amp;nbsp;However, they are not in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. &amp;nbsp;The gametes that reflect the parental arrangement of alleles (b+vg+ and bvg) occur more frequently than the recombinant arrangement. &amp;nbsp;We call the orignal arrangement the parental gametes and those that result from crossing over are the recombinant gametes. &amp;nbsp;This means that we call the offspring that result from the parental gametes - parental and those that result from the recombinant gametes are recombinant offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine the distance between the gene for body color and wing size - you use the equation shown here - divide the # of recombinant offspring by the total number of offspring and multiply by 100. &amp;nbsp;This gives the recombination frequency which we can use as a measure of distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 10&lt;br&gt;The gene for body color is 17 map units from the gene for wing size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 11&lt;br&gt;By doing crosses like this one, we can create a linkage map which provides the order and relative position of genes along a chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Chromosome Behavior and Gene Linkage Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;The topic of this tutorial is linked genes - genes that are linked to each other as a result of being on the same chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the more challenging topics we will discuss this semester so you will want to spend time thinking carefully about this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand linked genes we will look at dihybrid crosses in fruit flies.&amp;nbsp; These dihybrid crosses will be different from the dihbrid crosses that Mendel observed.&amp;nbsp; In Mendel's classic dihybrid crosses, the genes were not linked.&amp;nbsp; Each gene was found on a different chromosome - for example, we see in this image that the gene for seed color is found on the pink chromosome pair while the gene for seed texture is found on the blue chromosome pair.&amp;nbsp; Because these genes are on different chromosomes they will assort independently from each other during meiosis (please review independent assortment from Tutorial 2).&amp;nbsp; A pea plant that is heterozygous for the two genes can produce four different gamete types YR, yr, Yr, and yR - and they are produced in a 1:1:1:1 ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;Chromosomes do not carry just a single gene - each chromosome has many genes on it.&amp;nbsp; When these genes are relatively close together (closer than 50 map units - map units are measurement that we will talk more about later) they are considered linked because they are physically connected to each other by the structure of the chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because linked genes are physically connected they do not assort independently during meiosis.&amp;nbsp; In this image we see the genes for body color, eye color, and wing size in the fruit fly.&amp;nbsp; These genes are linked because they are on the same chromosome and they are closer than 50 map units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;To understand the behavior of linked genes we need to understand crossing over between homologous chromosomes.&amp;nbsp; Remember, homologous chromosomes are the members of a pair with one being inherited from the female parent and one inherited from the male parent.&amp;nbsp; They are the same size and shape and have the same genes.&amp;nbsp; However, they can have different alleles. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this diagram, we see a homologous pair of chromosomes with three genes - genes A, B, and C.&amp;nbsp; The dark green chromosome has the alleles a, b, and c and the light green chromosome has the alleles A, B, and C (please note - a chromosome does not have to have either all dominant or all recessive alleles - as we see at the end of meiosis in this diagram - chromosomes can have different combinations of dominant and recessive alleles).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to meiosis, the chromosomes replicate themselves.&amp;nbsp; During prophase I of meiosis I, the homologous chromosomes come together and synapse.&amp;nbsp; It is at this time that crossing over takes place.&amp;nbsp; Remember, crossing over is an equal exchange of DNA between non-sister chromatids.&amp;nbsp; In this diagram, crossing over is taking place between the two innermost non-sister chromatids (crossing over only takes place between non-sister chromatids).&amp;nbsp; This particular crossover has taken place between genes B and C.&amp;nbsp; The result is that four different gamete types have been produced - abc, abC, ABc, and ABC.&amp;nbsp; However, unlike unlinked genes - these gamete types are not produced in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;When we are talking about gamete production we are talking about what is happening in a large number of cells at once - not just a single cell going through meiosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason the gametes are not produced in a 1:1:1:1 ratio is because crossing over is random event.&amp;nbsp; In some cells, a crossover will take place between genes B and C but in other cells a cross over may take place between genes A and B.&amp;nbsp; In other cells a cross over could take place between genes on the other arm of the chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So some crossover events create gametes with the genotypes abc, abC, ABc, and ABC but other crossover events will not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closer two genes are together - the less likely it is that a crossover will occur between them and the less likely it is that the alleles will recombine.&amp;nbsp; So in this example, it is less likely that a crossover will occur between genes A and B than it is that a crossover will occur between genes A and C. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;In other words, the recombination frequency will be greater between genes A and C than it will be between genes A and B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that we can use recombination frequency as a measure of distance between two genes - genes A and C recombine more often so we know that they are farther apart.&amp;nbsp; Genes A and B recombine less often so we know that they are closer together (as we will see - we can observe recombination but we do not have the ability to see genes on chromosomes).&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Chromosome Behavior and Sex Chromosomes Part 4 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;This first question asks you to think about how an X-linked recessive trait is passed through generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;The answer is B - the man's maternal grandfather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;To understand this answer - it is best to write out what you know about the genotype of the man and his parents.&amp;nbsp; He has red-green colorblindness and we know his parents have normal vision - therefore his mother must be a carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;That means we can disregard the man's father's side of the family - the allele for colorblindness was passed to him from his mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question asks which grandparent is most likely to have red-green colorblindness?&amp;nbsp; We know that this condition is more common in males than females so the maternal grandfather is most likely to have the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;This question test your understanding of the role that the X and Y chromosome play in sex determination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;The answer is A - male.&amp;nbsp; Any individual that inherits a functional Y chromosome will develop into a male.&amp;nbsp; It is possible for someone with a Y chromosome to develop into a phenotypic female - if there is a problem with the Y chromosomes or key genes found on the chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7&lt;br&gt;Hopefully this was an easy question! &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 8&lt;br&gt;The answer is C - no!&amp;nbsp; Remember, males only have one copy of the X chromosome so they cannot be carriers.&amp;nbsp; They can only be hemizygous for X-linked traits (except in the rare case when a male has two X chromosomes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 9&lt;br&gt;This question is best answered by creating a Punnett square involving the two parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 10&lt;br&gt;The answer is D - half her sons will have normal vision and half her sons will be colorblind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 11&lt;br&gt;A Punnett square let's us visualize why option D was the untrue statement.&amp;nbsp; The female is red-green colorblind while the male is normal.&amp;nbsp; A Punnett square shows that all the sons will be colorblind.&amp;nbsp; So D was the untrue statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about these practice problems - please let me know.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Chromosome Behavior and Sex Chromosomes Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Chromosome Behavior and Sex Chromosomes Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;Let's look at some examples of X-linked traits in humans as well as a phenomenon known as X-inactivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two examples of sex-linked traits in humans are red-green colorblindness and hemophilia.&amp;nbsp; The genes that control these traits are found on the X chromosome.&amp;nbsp; Both conditions are recessive so both conditions are rare in females (remember, females need to inherit two copies of the recessive allele to have the trait whereas males only need to inherit a single copy so it is statistically more likely for a male to express the trait).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red-green colorblindness is the result of a mutation in a gene on the X chromosome that controls a person's ability to distinguish red and green pigments.&amp;nbsp; This condition is rare in women (in the United States about .4% of women have the condition). It is relatively common in males however, with about 7% of the population exhibiting the trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hemophilia A is a blood clotting disorder that is due to a mutation in a gene on the X chromosome.&amp;nbsp; The affected person does not make the proper blood clotting protein and suffers uncontrollable bleeding when injured.&amp;nbsp; This is a very serious condition and historically was a disease that was lethal during childhood (today we have medicines that can help with the symptoms of the disease but it is still a very serious condition).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;Genes code for proteins.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, females should have double the amount of protein for X-linked genes that males do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But - they don�t.&amp;nbsp; Which is a good thing because double the amount of protein can be lethal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why don�t they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;A phenomenon known as X-inactivation explains why female mammals don't have double the amount of protein for X-linked genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that only one X-chromosome remains active in each female cell.&amp;nbsp; The other X-chromosome becomes inactivated.&amp;nbsp; The inactivated chromosome condenses into a structure known as a Barr body.&amp;nbsp; This condensed chromosome essentially hides the genes on the chromosome so they cannot be expressed to produce protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This inactivation occurs early in development and in humans and many other mammals it is random - meaning that it is equally likely that the X inherited from m will be inactivated as it is that the X inhertied from dad will be inactivated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This inactivation process is genetically controlled and is due to a gene referred to as "XIST".&amp;nbsp; The XIST gene is found on the X chromosome and codes for its own inactivation.&amp;nbsp; Only one X chromosome expresses the gene and becomes condensed into a Barr body.&amp;nbsp; You can see a a barr body in this image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process of X-inactivation has an important consequence for females that are heterozygous because it can lead to a mosaic phenotype - this means a phenotype in which parts of the individual express the gene on one X chromosome and other parts of her body will express the other X's genes.&amp;nbsp; A nice example of this is calico coloration in cats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;Calico cats have patches of orange fur and patches of gray or black fur (the white coloration is due to a different gene).&amp;nbsp; The gene that controls orange vs gray is found on the X chromosome.&amp;nbsp; If a female is heterozygous, this means that she has the allele for orange color on one X and the allele for gray color on the other.&amp;nbsp; The parts of her coat that are gray have the X with the gray allele activated and the X with the orange allele inactivated.&amp;nbsp; The parts of her coat that are orange have the X with the orange allele activated and the X with the gray allele inactivated.&amp;nbsp; She has a mosaic or patchy phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A human example of this phenomenon is a condition known as ecotdermal dysplasia - the recessive allele for this character results in no production of sweat glands.&amp;nbsp; A heterozygous female will have patches of skin that produce sweat glands and patches of skin that do not produce sweat glands.&amp;nbsp; For the woman, this does not typically cause any serious health problems.&amp;nbsp; However, if she passes the recessive allele for the condition to a son - he will be born with the ability to produce sweat glands.&amp;nbsp; This is a very serious condition because sweating is one of the body's most important means of controlling temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While X inactivation is mainly a phenomenon in females - it can occur in males.&amp;nbsp; If a male inherits two copies of the X chromosome and has the chromosome complement of XXY (a condition known as Klinefelter's syndrome) one of his X chromosomes will become inactivated.&amp;nbsp; While rare, it is possible to find a calico male cat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Chromosome Behavior and Sex Chromosomes Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Chromosome Behavior and Sex Chromosomes Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;Do traits on sex chromosomes behave differently?&amp;nbsp; Why or why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;Yes and no - yes because males and females have different sex chromosomes (males=XY, females=XX).&amp;nbsp; No because sex chromosomes go through meiosis just like autosomes. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;Humans (and most mammals) as well as fruit flies have an X-Y system of sex determination - females have two copies of the X chromosome and males have an X and a Y.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During meiosis, the X and Y chromosome behave somewhat like a homologous pair - in males the X and Y segregate from each other just like homolgous pairs do - the result is that males produce two kinds of gametes - gametes with an X chromosome or gametes with a Y chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Females can only make gametes with an X chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;Sex-linked genes are genes that are found on the sex-chromosomes.&amp;nbsp; Because males and females have a different complement of sex chromosomes we expect sex-linked genes to show a different pattern of inheritance in males and females.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this course, we will limit our discussion of sex-linked genes to genes found on this X chromosome.&amp;nbsp; This is because the Y chromosome is significantly smaller than the X chromosome and does not contain many genes (although the Y chromosome does contain the genes that make a male a male). &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the X and Y behave like homologs during meiosis - there is in reality very little homology between them - in other words, they do not have the same genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that typically males only have one copy of each gene found on the X chromosome.&amp;nbsp; We use the term "hemizygous" to describe this condition.&amp;nbsp; A male cannot be homozygous or heterozygous for X-linked genes - because he only has one copy of the X chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;The X-Y system of sex-determination is only one way sex is determined in organisms.&amp;nbsp; Some insects, for example cockroaches, use a system known as X-O - females have two X chromosomes just as in humans but males just have a single X chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birds have a system known as Z-W - there are two different sex chromosomes but in birds it is the female that has two different sex chromosomes and the male has two that are the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some insects, known as the eusocial insects because of their highly social behavior and include species of ants and bees, have a sex-determination system known as haplo-diploidy.&amp;nbsp; In these insects there are no distinct sex chromosomes - instead the males are haploid and the females are diploid.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;The specific examples of sex-linked inheritance that we will look at will only involve organisms with an XY system of sex determination such as humans and fruit flies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some important consequences of gemes being found on the X chromosome that are not found on the Y chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, only females can be carriers for sex-linked recessive traits - remember that carriers are heterozygous and males cannot be heterozygous for X-linked traits (and are termed hemizygous).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, males will always express an X-linked trait - whether it is dominant or recessive.&amp;nbsp; This is in contrast to females - for a female to express a sex-linked recessive trait she must have two copies of the recessive allele.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7&lt;br&gt;Here are some examples of Punnett squares that examine sex-linked crosses.&amp;nbsp; Notice that when creating a Punnett square for an x-linked trait you must include both the X and Y chromosome for the male so you can keep track of inheritance differences between males and females.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In scenario 1, a homozygous dominant female is crossed with an affected male (this trait is x-linked recessive).&amp;nbsp; The result is that all female offspring will be carriers for the trait and all males will be unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In scenario 2, the female is a carrier and the male is unaffected.&amp;nbsp; In the resulting offspring, the females are either homozygous dominant or carriers.&amp;nbsp; The males are either unaffected or affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In scenario 3, the female is a carrier and the male is affected.&amp;nbsp; This is the only scenario in which it is possible to see affected female offspring. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X-linked recessive traits are expressed more commonly in males than in females.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Expression of Multiple Alleles Pedigrees Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Expression of Multiple Alleles Pedigrees Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;Human pedigrees describe the interrelationships between parents and children, over generations, regarding a specific trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is in contrast to a Punnett square that allows you to make predictions about future offspring&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;Because relationships between individuals (whether we are talking about humans or pedigreed dogs) can become quite complicated - pedigrees can also become quite complicated.&amp;nbsp; There are symbols to indicate the different types of relationships that can exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;For this class, we will restrict our use of symbols to those that are circled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Squares refer to males and circles refer to females.&amp;nbsp; If the square or circle is empty - the individual is termed "normal" and does not exhibit the trait that is being analyzed in the pedigree.&amp;nbsp; If the square or circle is filled in - the individual is termed as "affected" with the trait. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be aware that the term "normal" has a very specific meaning in genetics that derives from statistics - it means the "norm" or average phenotype and has no connotation about weirdness or strangeness. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a shape is half-filled in that indicates that the indivdual is a carrier.&amp;nbsp; A carrier is an individual who "carries" a recessive allele but is phenotypically normal.&amp;nbsp; In other words, a carrier is an individual who is heterozygous for a recessive condition.&amp;nbsp; Carriers will not always be indicated on a pedigree - questions on the quiz may require you to determine who the carriers are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horizontal lines between a circle and square means that the two are mating partners.&amp;nbsp; Vertical lines that descend from this horizontal line indicate offspring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;We see these features in this simple pedigree of a recessive trait.&amp;nbsp; The circle is the female and the square is the male.&amp;nbsp; The line connecting them indicates that they are partners.&amp;nbsp; They have two children a daughter and a son.&amp;nbsp; The daughter is the first born (birth order is indicated left to right).&amp;nbsp; The son is affected by the trait. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how can we tell that this trait is recessive?&amp;nbsp; Because neither mom nor dad has the condition but the son does.&amp;nbsp; This means that both parents must be carriers for the condition - they are both heterozygous. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;We can use a Punnett square to reinforce this idea of carriers.&amp;nbsp; If the trait is recessive, both parents can "carry" the allele and not express it - but they can have a child with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;This pedigree shows a trait that most likely has dominant inheritance.&amp;nbsp; How can we tell?&amp;nbsp; Well, when we look at the pedigree - there is no evidence of carriers.&amp;nbsp; All affected children have at least one affected parent.&amp;nbsp; So for this pedigree - the most likely mode of inheritance is dominant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Expression of Multiple Alleles Pedigrees Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Expression of Multiple Alleles Pedigrees Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;The examples we have looked at thus far, have only included genes with two alleles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many genes, however, have more than two alleles in the population - a situation referred to as multiple alleles.&amp;nbsp; Note - each diploid individual in the population is diploid can only have at most two different alleles - but in the entire population there can be more than two alleles. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fairly straightforward example of this is the human ABO blood group.&amp;nbsp; There are 3 alleles - the A allele (indicated with a capital I superscript A), the B allele (indicated with a capital I and a superscript B), and the O allele indicated with a lower case i.&amp;nbsp; Within this group there are two different dominance relationships.&amp;nbsp; We have already discussed how allele A and allele B are codominant to each other.&amp;nbsp; Both of these alleles (A and B), are completely dominant to allele O.&amp;nbsp; An individual who is heterozygous for A and O has blood type A.&amp;nbsp; Similarly for an individual who is heterozygous for B and O has blood type B.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;Sometimes a gene can have an effect on more than one aspect of an organism's phenotype.&amp;nbsp; This situation is referred to as pleiotropy. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;An example of pleiotropy is the frizzle gene in chickens.&amp;nbsp; This gene is referred to as "frizzle" because it results in frizzy looking feathers.&amp;nbsp; The gene that causes this phenotype also causes the chicken to have abnormal body temperature, higher metabolic and blood flow rates, and greater digestive capacity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a single gene, we will call it gene X, that has an impact on all of these aspects of the chicken's phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;Epistasis refers to a relationship between at least two different genes and one gene affects expression of another gene (or genes).&amp;nbsp; A common example of epistasis is coat color in mammals. The example we are looking at here is coat color in horses.&amp;nbsp; There are two different genes that play a role in determining coat color.&amp;nbsp; Gene B codes for pigment - with the dominant B allele coding for black coat color and the recessive b allele coding for a lighter brown coat color.&amp;nbsp; Gene C is epistatic on gene B (epistasis literally means "standing upon") - it determines whether or not gene B gets expressed.&amp;nbsp; The dominant C allele allows the pigment to be deposited - so a horse that has at least one copy of the C allele will be either black or brown.&amp;nbsp; The recessive c allele, on the other hand, blocks pigment deposition - any horse that has two copies of the c allele (is homozygous recessive for c) - will be a whitish color.&amp;nbsp; This is because gene C is epistatic on gene B and controls whether or not it is expressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;Epistasis and pleiotropy are often confused with each other but they are quite different.&amp;nbsp; One important difference is the number of genes involved.&amp;nbsp; Epistasis involves at least two genes but only one aspect of the phenotype is affected.&amp;nbsp; Coat color in horses is an example - two genes but only one character - coat color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pleiotropy involves a singe gene - but the gene impacts several aspects of the phenotype - like frizzled chickens with their different body temperature and metabolism.&amp;nbsp; A single gene caused all of these changes to the phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;Most genetic traits are not determined by a single gene - most traits are polygenic (the prefix poly means many).&amp;nbsp; Skin color in humans, for example, is a polygenic trait.&amp;nbsp; Here at Penn State, Dr. Mark Shriver in the department of anthropology is attempting to work out the exact number of genes that are responsible for skin color in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model organism that he uses to learn more about our pigment genes is actually a small species of fish known as a zebrafish (zebrfish are common lab organisms).&amp;nbsp; The gene that he is currently looking at is known as SLC24A5 - catch huh?&amp;nbsp; This gene plays a role in pigment production in both zebrafish and humans.&amp;nbsp; We know that there are other genes involved in skin color and other research groups around the world are looking at these genes.&amp;nbsp; Some day we may know all of the genes that are responsible for skin color in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Expression of Multiple Alleles Complex Expression Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2 id="page-title" property="oer:name"&gt;Expression of Multiple Alleles Complex Expression Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;The classic Mendelian genetic crosses we have looked at thus far in the course only included genes with two alleles and those two alleles had a complete dominant-recessive relationship.&amp;nbsp; This means that one allele - for example the purple flower allele in pea plants - is dominant to the alternative allele - the white flower allele. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However,as we shall see, relationships between alleles are not always dominant-recessive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;There are 3 basic "Flavors" of dominance relationships between alleles. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complete Dominance - "Mendelian inheritance"&lt;br&gt;One allele (dominant) completely masks other (recessive)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incomplete dominance&lt;br&gt;Both alleles contribute to phenotype, but heterozygote is intermediate to either homozygote (i.e., in monohybrid cross, three phenotypes are observed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-dominance&lt;br&gt;Both alleles contribute equally to phenotype-no masking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we will look at some examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;Incomplete dominance occurs when both alleles contribute to the organisms phenotype and the heterozygous individuals have an intermediate phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example is flower color in snapdragons.&amp;nbsp; In snapdragons there are two alleles for color - red and white.&amp;nbsp; Notice that the way these alleles are written is slightly different than the way completely dominant/recessive alleles are written. Because neither allele is completely dominant it is not appropriate to use upper and lower case letters.&amp;nbsp; Instead, the gene is named after the character - in this case gene C is for flower color.&amp;nbsp; And the alleles are superscripted - R for the red allele and W for the white allele.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red flowered snapdragons are homozygous for the red allele and white flowered snapdragons are homozygous for the white allele.&amp;nbsp; Pink flowered snapdragons are heterozygous - pink is a color that is intermediate between red and white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;In a codominant relationship - both alleles are equally expressed in the phenotype and the heterozygous individuals have a unique phenotype.&amp;nbsp; We will look at the human ABO blood group as an example.&amp;nbsp; For now - we will just look at alleles A and B (we will talk about allele O later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The A allele codes for an A sugar that sits on the surface of human red blood cells.&amp;nbsp; The B allele codes for a B sugar that sits on the surface of human red blood cells.&amp;nbsp; If someone has both the A allele and the B allele - they will have both A and B sugars on the surface of their red blood cells.&amp;nbsp; The two alleles are codominant and the heterozygous phenotype is unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;To summarize the relationships between alleles we can look at this dominance continuum.&amp;nbsp; The only way to determine the relationship between alleles is by analyzing the heterozygotes - the homozygous individuals don't tell us anything about how two different alleles interact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In complete dominance, the heterozygote is indistinguishable from the homozygous dominant individuals. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In incomplete dominance, the heterozygote has a phenotype that is intermediate beween both homozygotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In codominance, the heterozygote has a unique phenotype because both alleles are fully expressed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Phenotypes and Genotypes Probability Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Phenotypes and Genotypes Probability Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;Phenotypes and Genotypes Probability Part 2 VoiceThread TranscriptSo, let's work through the solution to these practice problems.&amp;nbsp; Assume you have an F1 generation that is heterozygous for 3 genes - genes A, B, and C.&amp;nbsp; What is the probability of them having an offspring with genotype aabbcc?&amp;nbsp; What is the probability of them having an offspring that is heterozygous for all three genes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;First, let's take time to determine how many gamete types each parent can make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each parent is heterozygous for three different genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;Use the equation 2^n = # different gamete types, n=#heterozygous genes&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;In this example there are 3 heterozygous genes so each parent makes 8 different gamete types (2^3 = 8)&lt;br&gt;How big would the Punnett square be? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;8 x 8 = 64 different squares - too big!&amp;nbsp; So let's use probability theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;So what is the probability of an offspring of genotype aabbcc?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let�s look at it gene by gene:&lt;br&gt;Gene A:&amp;nbsp; aa - there is a � probability of getting a from parent 1 and a � probability of getting a from parent 2 - so the overall probability is � x � = �&lt;br&gt;Gene B: bb - there is a � probability of getting b from parent 1 and a � probability of getting b from parent 2 - so the overall probability is � x � = �&lt;br&gt;Gene C: cc - there is a � probability of getting c from parent 1 and a � probability of getting c from parent 2 - so the overall probability is � x � = �&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall probability is � x � x � = 1/64.&amp;nbsp; Remember, the question is asking you what is the probability of getting genotype aa AND genotype bb AND genotype cc so you need to multiply the individual probabilities together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;So what is the probability of an offspring of genotype AaBbCc?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let�s look at it gene by gene:&lt;br&gt;Gene A:&amp;nbsp; Aa - there are two ways to be heterozygous - you can either get A from parent 1 and a from parent 2 (� x � = �) OR a from parent 1 and A from parent 2 (� x � = �) .&amp;nbsp; You can use a Punnett square to visualize this idea.&amp;nbsp; Notice - I am using a small 4 square Punnett square to help you visualize - not a 64 square Punnett square!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the probability of an offspring having genotype Aa is 1/2 (� + � = �).&amp;nbsp; We use both rules of probability in this example - the rule of multiplication to determine the probability of either Aa or aA and the rule of addition to calculate the overall probability of being heterozygous for A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7&lt;br&gt;We use the same logic for genes B and C. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gene B:&amp;nbsp; Bb - there are two ways to be heterozygous - you can either get B from parent 1 and b from parent 2 (� x � = �) OR b from parent 1 and B from parent 2 (� x � = �) .&lt;br&gt;Gene C:&amp;nbsp; Cc - there are two ways to be heterozygous - you can either get C from parent 1 and c from parent 2 (� x � = �) OR c from parent 1 and C from parent 2 (� x � = �) .&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall probability is � x � x � = 1/8&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;Punnett squares are useful tools for making predictions about simple genetic crosses.&amp;nbsp; However, they quickly become cumbersome when we advance our genetic analysis to multiple genes. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more advanced genetic analysis, probability theory is an easier way to make predictions about future offspring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;There are two rules of probability you need to be aware of - the rule of multiplication and the rule of addition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will look at the rule of multiplication first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rule of Multiplication says that to determine the probability of an event occurring, determine the individual probabilities of each independent event, and then multiply the individual probabilities to obtain the probability of these events occurring together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to think about this is that if you use the word "and" you multiply.&amp;nbsp; Let's look at an example to demonstrate this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the probability of rolling a 5 and then a 3 with a fair die?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice this question uses the word "and" - so you need to determine the probability of rolling a 5 (1/6) and the probability of rolling a 3 (1/6) and multiply these individual probabilities together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;So, the overall probability of rolling first a 5 and then a 3 is 1/36.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;The second rule you need to know is the rule of addition.&amp;nbsp; The Rule of Addition says that if an event can occur in more than one way, the probability of that event occurring is equal to the sum of the probabilities of each different way that the event can occur.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to think about this rule is that you are using the word "or" so you need to add.&amp;nbsp; Let's look at an example to demonstrate this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the probability of rolling a 5 when rolling 2 dice?&lt;br&gt;First, you need to recognize that there are four different ways to roll a 5 - you can roll a 3 and a 2, OR a 2 and a 3, OR a 4 and a 1, OR a 1 and a 4.&amp;nbsp; Each die is unique and you need to consider each die independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probability of rolling a 3 and 2 is 1/6 x 1/6= 1/36.&lt;br&gt;The probability of rolling a 2 and 3 is 1/6 x 1/6= 1/36.&lt;br&gt;The probability of rolling a 1 and 4 is 1/6 x 1/6= 1/36.&lt;br&gt;The probability of rolling a 4 and 1 is 1/6 x 1/6= 1/36.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the overall probability of rolling any one of these combinations you add the individual probabilities together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;So the overall probability is 4/36.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;So let's apply these rules to a three gene genetics problem.&amp;nbsp; Assume you have an F1 generation that is heterozygous for 3 genes - genes A, B, and C.&amp;nbsp; What is the probability of them having an offspring with genotype aabbcc?&amp;nbsp; What is the probability of them having an offspring that is heterozygous for all three genes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, if you use a Punnett square, you will need an 8 x 8 or 64 square Punnett square!&amp;nbsp; Using probability will be much easier once you get the hang of it.&amp;nbsp; Once you have the answers - access the next VoiceThread.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Phenotypes and Genotypes Punnett Squares VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2 id="page-title" property="oer:name"&gt;Phenotypes and Genotypes Punnett Squares VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;To understand genetics and be able to make predictions about genetic crosses, it is crucial that you understand meiosis.&amp;nbsp; This diagram, from Tutorial 2, is an overview of meiosis.&amp;nbsp; Make sure that you understand this diagram and the diagram of independent assortment from Tutorial 2 before you start to attempt genetics problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;The most basic example of a genetic cross is a monohybrid cross.&amp;nbsp; The prefix mono means one - so in a monohybrid cross we are tracking the inheritance of a single trait.&amp;nbsp; We have already been introduced to monohybrid crosses when we looked at examples of Mendel's classic crosses. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When performing a genetic cross, we have a handy tool that we can use called a Punnett square.&amp;nbsp; To create a Punnett square we first need to determine the different gamete types our parent individuals can make with respect to the gene that we are tracking.&amp;nbsp; For example, we now know that the F1 individuals in Mendel's classic cross involving flower color are all heterozygous.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, each F1 individual can make two different possible gamete types with respect to the gene for flower color - gametes with a P and gametes with a p.&amp;nbsp; We construct our Punnett square by lining up these possible gametes along the axes of our square.&amp;nbsp; So a female pea plant can produce two types of eggs - P and p.&amp;nbsp; A male pea plant can produce two types of sperm - P and p.&amp;nbsp; We write these gametes out along the axes of the square and then fill in the squares accordingly. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Punnett square allows us to visualize the 3:1 phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation.&amp;nbsp; Note, while the phenotypic ratio is 3:1 the genotypic ratio is 1:2:1.&amp;nbsp; 1 homozygous dominant to 2 heterozygotes to 1 homozygous recessive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Punnett square allows us to visualize the cross and make predictions about offspring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;When an organism exhibits a dominant trait, we cannot know its genotype by simply looking at it.&amp;nbsp; For example, this purple-flowered pea plant - we can't know whether it is homozygous dominant or heterozygous just by looking at it.&amp;nbsp; But there is a way we can figure out its genotype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;A test cross allows us to determine the genotype of an organism of unknown genotype.&amp;nbsp; To perform a test cross, it is typical to cross the individual of unknown genotype (and dominant phenotype) to an individual that is homozygous recessive.&amp;nbsp; In this example, we don't know whether the purple flowered individual is homozygous dominant or heterozygoud.&amp;nbsp; But we do know that a white-flowered individual has to be homozygous recessive.&amp;nbsp; When we cross our unknown individual with our known individual - we can tell the unknown individual's genotype by analyzing the offspring.&amp;nbsp; If all the offspring are purple, our unknown individual has the genotype PP.&amp;nbsp; If half of the offspring are white and half purple, our unknown individual has the genotype Pp.&amp;nbsp; Notice, this type of analysis only works with organisms that have large numbers of offspring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;We can increase the complexity of our genetic analysis by increasing the number of traits we are tracking.&amp;nbsp; A dihybrid cross tracks the inheritance of two traits ("Di" means two).&amp;nbsp; To understand this dihybrid cross, you must understand Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, we are tracking the inheritance of the alleles for seed color (yellow versus green) and seed shape (round vs. wrinkled).&amp;nbsp; The P generation is comprised of true-breeding round, yellow individuals and true-breeding green, wrinkled individuals.&amp;nbsp; The genes for these characters are found on different chromsomes so the genes assort independently of each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The F1 generation is all round, yellow - this tells us that round and yellow are the dominant traits (and green and wrinkled are recessive).&amp;nbsp; When we self individuals from the F1 we see a 9:3;3:1 phenotypic ratio in the F2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note, in this example each parent can make 4 different possible gamete types (RY, Ry, rY, and ry).&amp;nbsp; This means our Punnett Square is 4 x 4 or 16 squares large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;To understand how to set up the Punnett square - we need to understand how meiosis and independent assortment create the 4 different possible gamete types.&amp;nbsp; This image shows a diagram of meiosis in an F1 individual from our previous cross.&amp;nbsp; All F1 individuals are heterozygous (RrYy).&amp;nbsp; Gene R is found on a different chromosome than gene Y so how gene R assorts into gametes is independent of how gene Y assorts.&amp;nbsp; In this example, let's assume that gene R is on the green chromosome and gene Y is on the blue.&amp;nbsp; There are two possible ways the chromosomes can align themselves at metaphase I - either light green with light blue and dark green with dark blue - resulting in RY and ry gametes OR light green with dark blue and dark green with light blue resulting in Ry and rY gametes.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, our heterozygous F1 individuals make 4 different possible gamete types - RY, ry, Ry, and rY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7&lt;br&gt;These are the four gamete types that we line up along the Punnett Square in our dihybrid cross.&amp;nbsp; Then we fill in the squares (it is best to keep the Rs together and the Ys together) and determine the phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has 3 pairs of autosomal chromosomes and an X and Y chromosome (males are XY, females are XX).&amp;nbsp; How many different chromosome combinations are produced by independent assortment in D. melanogaster?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is 16 different chromosome combinations.&lt;br&gt;2^4 = 16&lt;br&gt;In this example, there are 4 homologous pairs of chromosomes (the X and Y are not truly homologous but they behave like homologs during meiosis)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;An individual has genotype AaBbCC.&amp;nbsp; How many different gamete types can this individual make with respect to these genes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is 4.&amp;nbsp; There are two heterozygous genes - gene A and gene B.&amp;nbsp; Gene C is homozygous and does not result in any genetic variation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2^2 = 4, where 2 = # of heterozygous genes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;An individual has genotype AaBbCc. How many different gamete types can this individual make with respect to these genes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is 8.&amp;nbsp; In this example, all 3 genes are heterozygous. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2^3 = 8, where 3 = # of heterozygous genes&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Mendel and Modern Genetics Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Mendel and Modern Genetics Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;So let's remind ourselves what Mendel did to perform his crosses.&amp;nbsp; He always started his P-generation with two true-breeding parents of opposite phenotype (in this example, purple vs. white).&amp;nbsp; He would cross these two individuals to get the F1-generation which is comprised only of purple-flowered individuals. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals from the F1 generation were self-fertilized to produce the F2 generation.&amp;nbsp; The F2 generation was always comprised of purple and white-flowered plants in a 3:1 ratio.&amp;nbsp; So if he counted 1000 offspring in the F2 - he would expect to find approximately 750 purple flowered plants and 250 white flowered plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mendel did this cross many, many times and he always found the same results.&amp;nbsp; He also did the same type of crosses with other traits in pea plants such as pea pod color, seed color, and seed texture.&amp;nbsp; And in these crosses he also found the same results - all the F1-generation individuals had the same phenotype and the F2-generation showed two phenotypes in a 3:1 ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These consistent results allowed Mendel to make some basic conclusions about the laws that govern inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;So, what did Mendel conclude?&amp;nbsp; First, we need to remember that Mendel was doing his work in the mid-1800s and the inheritance role of DNA was not discovered until the 1950s.&amp;nbsp; So Mendel did not know about genes and alleles but he was able to infer their basic existence.&amp;nbsp; In his writings, he did not use the terms genes and alleles or chromosomes and diploid - but I will use this modern terminology to discuss Mendel's conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His first conclusion was that each diploid individual has 2 copies of each gene - one coming from the female parent and one coming from the male parent.&amp;nbsp; In this diagram, let's say the dark green chromosome has come from the dad and the light green chromosome has come from the mom.&amp;nbsp; For genes a, b, c, d, and e - an individual has two copies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;His second conclusion was that if an individual inherits two different copies of a gene (2 different alleles), one will be dominant and one will be recessive.&amp;nbsp; Remember, standard convention is to indicate a dominant allele with a capital letter and a recessive allele with a lowercase letter.&amp;nbsp; If the 2 alleles are the same - the individual is referred to as homozygous and if the two alleles are different the individual is referred to as heterozygous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;Mendel's next conclusion was that recessive traits are only expressed if an individual inherits two copies of the recessive allele (is homozygous recessive).&amp;nbsp; Remember, if an individual inherits even one copy of a dominant allele - the phenotype of that individual is dominant.&amp;nbsp; The only way to express a recessive trait is to have two copies of the recessive allele.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;Mendel also concluded that when an individual produces gametes (remember, gametes are either sperm or eggs) the alleles for a gene segregate into different gametes.&amp;nbsp; This is known as Mendel's Law of Segregation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;To understand Mendel's Law of Segregation, you need to understand meiosis.&amp;nbsp; Remember, during meiosis I the homologous chromosomes separate from each other.&amp;nbsp; In this diagram from Tutorial 2 I have added gene labels from a hypothetical gene R.&amp;nbsp; Our parent individual is heterozygous for gene R and the dominant R allele is found on the dark green chromosome and the recessive r allele is found on the light green chromosome.&amp;nbsp; When these two chromosomes separate from each other during meiosis I, the alleles on these chromosomes also separate from each other.&amp;nbsp; The result is that this individual makes 2 different types of gametes with respect to this gene - gametes with a big R and gametes with a little r.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7&lt;br&gt;It is important to also remember Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment.&amp;nbsp; We were introduced to this idea in Tutorial 2.&amp;nbsp; Let's look at it again with gene labels - this time we will use genes R and G.&amp;nbsp; The original parent individual is heterozygous for both genes (RrGg).&amp;nbsp; Gene R is on a different chromosome than gene G (gene R is on the green chromosomes and gene G is on the blue chromosomes).&amp;nbsp; When the green pair of chromosomes lines up on the metaphase plate during metaphase I, they line up independently of the blue pair.&amp;nbsp; The light green can line up with the light blue and the dark green with the dark blue.&amp;nbsp; This alignment results in the production of gametes with the genotypes rg and RG.&amp;nbsp; Alternatively, the light green chromosome can line up with the dark blue and the dark green with the light blue.&amp;nbsp; This alignment results in the production of gametes with the genotypes rG and Rg.&amp;nbsp; All together, an individual with genotype RrGg can produce four different gamete types - rg, RG, rG, Rg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 8&lt;br&gt;We have already learned that an individual can produce 2n different combinations of chromosomes during meiosis (where n=# of homologous pairs)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use this same basic idea to calculate the number of different allele combinations produced during meiosis&lt;br&gt;2n = # of different allele combinatinos where n=# of heterozygous genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 9&lt;br&gt;So, let's try a few practice problems.&amp;nbsp; This first problem asks you to determine the number of different chromosome combinations a fruit fly can make.&amp;nbsp; The second two questions ask you to figure out the number of allele combinations an individual can make.&amp;nbsp; Once you have answered these questions - access the next VoiceThread to see the solutions.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phylum Ascomycota are sometimes called the "sac fungi" because they produce a sac-like structure known as an ascus to house their sexual spores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ascus is the distinguishing feature of this group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This a monophyletic group that is the largest most abundant group of fungi - about 75% of all fungi are members of this group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some important members of this group include the yeast we use to make beer and bread, the fungi that make up many types of lichen, some important plant parasites, and the organism that gave us the first antibiotic - penicillium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distinguishing characteristic of this group is the ascus.&amp;nbsp; An ascus is a sac-like structure that houses eight sexual ascospores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ascomycota can also reproduce asexually and produces spores known as conidia but these asexual spores are not produced in an ascus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ascus is only produced during sexual reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ascomycete sexual life cycle shows karyogamy, plasmogamy, and the formation of the dikaryon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two individuals of opposite mating type fuse together during plasmogamy to form the dikaryon - in this group the dikaryon is the ascus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the dikaryon, karyogamy takes place to produce the diploid stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diploid cells undergo meiosis to produce haploid spores.&amp;nbsp; Each spore then goes through mitosis to produce the eight sexual ascospores.&amp;nbsp; These ascospores are then released from the parent fungus to start the new generation.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two very important plant diseases caused by ascomycete fungi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dutch elm disease is a fungal disease that was first found in the U.S. in 1930.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is spread by the elm beetle and has spread throughout North America and has destroyed more than half of the elm trees.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American chestnut blight is another ascomycete disease that was first found in North America in approximately 1900. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1940, 3.5 billion chestnuts had died. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chestnuts were once a major hardwood component of eastern forests and now they are essentially gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penn State researchers have created a resistant strain and hope to replant forests - if you are interested I have included a link to the Penn State program.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ascomycete fungi also produce some important mycotoxins - which are toxic substances produced by fungi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aflatoxins are toxic substances that can cause diseases in humans and other species.&amp;nbsp; The symptoms of exposure can range from acute symptoms when large amounts of aflatoxins are consumed at once to chronic symptoms such as cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, aflatoxins are the most carcinogenic substances known.&amp;nbsp; Our food supply is screened to make sure that there are not excessive levels of aflatoxins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ergot is another toxin produced by fungi that grow on grains and can cause hallucinations.&amp;nbsp; Ergot poisoning was common in Europe prior to modern food processing.&amp;nbsp; In fact, it has been suggested that Ergot poisoning may have helped fuel the French revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more current concern is Sick House Syndrome&lt;br&gt;from the fungus Stachybotrys that grows on wet cellulose like the cellulose that can be found in dry wall.&amp;nbsp; Improper ventilation lets moisture build up and people can become sick when exposed to the fungal spores.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phylum Basidiomycota includes the classic mushrooms, puffballs, and shelf fungi&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are important decomposers in forest ecosystems because they digest cellulose and lignin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a monophyletic group and this group includes some important plant pathogens known as the&amp;nbsp; rusts, smuts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some members of this group are also Mycorrhizae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The life cycle of this group is characterized by basidia which are&amp;nbsp; club-shaped structures that house the sexual spores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basidiomycete sexual life cycle shows karyogamy, plasmogamy, and the formation of the dikaryon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two individuals of opposite mating type fuse together during plasmogamy to form the dikaryon - in this group the dikaryon is the basidium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the dikaryon, karyogamy takes place to produce the diploid stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diploid cells undergo meiosis to produce haploid spores.&amp;nbsp; These spores are then released from the parent fungus to start the new generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important members of this group include the rusts and smuts - diseases that affect plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wheat rust, for example,&amp;nbsp; can reduce wheat yields up to 40% and are economically important for this reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cedar apple rust is a disease that over winters on cedar trees and then infects apples and related species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corn smut is a basidiomycete disease that reduces corn yields - it is however, an edible fungus and is eaten in Mexico where it is called cuitlacoche. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Mendel and Modern Genetics Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Mendel and Modern Genetics Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;We are now beginning to learn about genetics.&amp;nbsp; To introduce the topic of genetics - we will start at the beginning with the father of genetics - Gregor Mendel.&amp;nbsp; Mendel was an Austrian monk and scientist who lived and worked in a monastary during the mid-1800s.&amp;nbsp; He is famous for his work on the inheritance of traits in garden peas.&amp;nbsp; Mendel showed that the inheritance of these traits follows particular laws, which were later named after him. The significance of Mendel's work was not recognized until the turn of the 20th century and the rediscovery of these laws form the foundation of the modern science of genetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;Mendel's work was very methodical.&amp;nbsp; The characters he chose to analyze were what we call "either-or" characters.&amp;nbsp; For example, in pea plants the flowers are either purple or white - they are the only two colors.&amp;nbsp; This image shows an example of a typical Mendelian cross - he would cross two individuals of opposite character - in this example purple crossed with white.&amp;nbsp; This first generation cross is known as the p-generation and the individuals in this cross are always true-breeding.&amp;nbsp; This means that if you cross a true-breeding purple flowered plant with itself (this is possible in plants) - it will only produce purple flowered offspring - it breeds true for purple flower color.&amp;nbsp; The same with the white flowered plant - cross it withitself and it produces white flowered offspring only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The generation that resulted from this cross is called the F1 generation.&amp;nbsp; In this particular cross - all the F1 individuals are purple flowered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cross of individuals from the F1 results in the F2 generation - and in this particular cross the F2 is comprised of a mix of purple and white flowered individuals in a 3 purple : 1 white ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;The characters that Mendel followed are genetic traits - they are due to the action of genes.&amp;nbsp; A gene is essentially a piece of DNA&amp;nbsp; (the material that chromosomes are made of) that codes for a specific character in an organism.&amp;nbsp; So for example, there is a gene that determines flower color in pea plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;An allele is a variant of a gene - alleles are repsonsible for the genetic variation within a population.&amp;nbsp; In our example of flower color, there are two alleles - purple and white that determine whether a flower is purple or white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;The alleles that an individual has determines its genotype.&amp;nbsp; So, for example, a pea plant with white flowers has two copies of the white allele.&amp;nbsp; Remember, most of the the organisms that we will discuss in this course are diploid - they have two copies of each chromosome and thus two copies of each gene found on those chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An organisms phenotype refers to its physical characteristics.&amp;nbsp; So an organism with two white alleles (its genotype) has the phenotype of white flowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;Here we see a visual example of genotype and phenotype.&amp;nbsp; In pea plants, the purple allele (which is indicated with an upper case P) is dominant.&amp;nbsp; That means that it gets expressed in any individual who inherits it.&amp;nbsp; So an organism that has two copies of the capital P allele or a single copy will have purple flowers.&amp;nbsp; When an organism has two alleles that are the same (for example, PP) we say they are homozygous for that gene.&amp;nbsp; When an organism has two alleles that are different (for example, Pp) we say that organism is heterozygous for that gene.&amp;nbsp; In this example, a homozygous individual can either be homozygous dominant (PP) or homozygous recessive (pp). &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The white allele is recessive.&amp;nbsp; This means that only individuals who have two copies of the white allele will have white flowers.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Fungi I Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phylum Chytridiomycota - or the chytrids are sometimes classified as protists but we now know that they belong in the fungi. This is not a monophyletic group so we know they will be reorganized. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These organisms are mostly aquatic - fungi evolved in the water so this is considered a primitive trait in this group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of this group are both saprobes and parasites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some have flagellated spores (only motile cells in kingdom) and this is the distinguishing characteristic of this group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some sources classify these organisms as a protist group - they do have a cell wall made of chitin which places them in the fungi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, a major threat to frogs is the chytrid fungus. This fungus feeds on keratin, a component of skin that makes it sturdy and tough. Tadpoles have only a little keratin around their mouths. But as frogs grow, their skin thickens on the soles of their feet and anywhere else their bodies repeatedly come in contact with the ground, such as the lower abdomen. So while the fungus doesn't usually affect tadpoles, it can kill adult frogs.&lt;br&gt;Researchers aren't yet sure of exactly how the fungus kills the frogs. The two prevailing theories are that the fungus produces lethal toxins or that its presence interferes with the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide through the skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present, scientists believe that this fungus came from African clawed frogs. The fungus does not affect them but does affect frogs that are not adapted to the fungus' presence.&amp;nbsp; As the African clawed frog has been released into new habitats, the infection has spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently there is no treatment for the infection and it is esimated that as many as 1/3 of all frog species are in danger of extinction from this chytrid infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microsporidians are a recent addition to the fungal kingdom and this is based on molecular data - particularly DNA sequence data that indicates that the microsporidians are more closely related to fungi than to any other group. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This group lacks functional mitochondria - instead they have mitosomes - structures similar to the mitosomes seen in some of the other organisms that we have looked at that used to be classified as "Archaezoa" that we learned about in our study of the protists. When we first learned about these organisms we originally classified them into these protist groups - however, we now know that they are members of the fungi.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an important group of organisms mainly because they are all intracellular parasites - mainly of invertebrate animals but a few species infect humans - particularly humans with compromised immune systems and this compromization of the immune system occurs when people develop diseases such as AIDS or have existing genetic conditions which compromise their immune health. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these organisms, however, may be beneficial to human health because we may be able to use them to kill other pest species.&amp;nbsp; For example, their is a group of microsporidians that specialize in infecting mosquitoes.&amp;nbsp; Mosquitos are a vector for the human disease malaria.&amp;nbsp; Malaria is the number one cause of infectious disease world-wide and kills almost 1 million people per year - mostly children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;Phylum zygomycota is comprised mainly of individuals that are terrestrial saprobes - bread mold is probably the most familiar representative of this group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a monophyletic group and most reproduction in this group is asexual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they do reproduce sexually, they produce a heterokaryotic structure known as a Zygosporangium - which is the distinguising feature of this group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are an ecologically important group because many of them are Mycorrhizae - the fungi that live symbiotically with plant roots.&amp;nbsp; In fact, about 90% of all plant species are known to have mycorrhizal fungi living with them.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The life cycle of the zygomycota shows the processes of plasmogamy, karyogamy, and the formation of the dikaryon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two individuals of opposite mating type fuse together during plasmogamy to form the dikaryon - in this group it is a zygosporangium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the zygosporangium, karyogamy takes place to produce the diploid stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diploid cells undergo meiosis to produce haploid spores which are released from the parent fungus to produce more individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the Zygomycota are used to produce some important products such as anesthetics, birth control pills, meat tenderizers,cortisones, pigments, tempeh,and soy sauce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phylum Glomeromycota is comprised of fungi that are arbuscular (shrub-like) mycorrhize that grow into the cells of plant roots.&amp;nbsp; These fungi help plants capture nutrients such as phosphorous, sulfur, nitrogen, and micronutrients - all from the soil.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is believed that the development of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis played a crucial role in the initial colonization of land by plants and in the evolution of the vascular plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most land plants have mycorrhizal symbionts and studies have shown that when these symbionts are taken away - the plants do not grow as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our knowledge of mycorrhizae is relatively new and it is beginning to influence our undertanding of agriculture and plant ecology.&amp;nbsp; For plants to grow well we need to care not only for them but for their fungal symbionts as well.&amp;nbsp; So remember, unhappy fungi means unhappy plants and that can mean less for us to eat.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Fungi I Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we continue our survey of earth's biodiversity, our next group of organisms are the members of Kingdom Fungi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are six major groups of fungi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microsporidians are the newest members of Kingdom Fungi and they are all anmals parasites.&amp;nbsp; We believe this group is monophyletic but as we learn more about them - this may change. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chytridiomycota (or "Chytrids") are a group of flagellated fungi - many of which are parasites.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We now think this group is paraphyletic and most likely will be reorganized. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Zygomycota includes common organisms such as bread mold - you know, the stuff that grows on your bread when you leave it on the counter too long.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This group is also paraphyletic and will be reorganized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining three groups are all thought to be monophyletic and include the glomeromycota (an important group of plant symbionts - we will talk more about them later). &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phylum Ascomycota are commonly referred to as the cup or the sac fungi because they have a cup or sac shaped fruiting body. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Basidiomycota are known as the club fungi because they have club-shaped fruiting bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like the plants and animals, the Fungi evolved from a protist ancestor - specifically single-celled protists with flagella.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fungi live in a variety of habitats and have a variety of modes of obtaining nutrients - but they are all chemoheterotrophs - just like us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some fungi are even predatory like this netatode-trapping fungus.&amp;nbsp; Nematodes are smal worm-like creatures that live in the soil and other environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nematode-trapping fungi develop loop traps that they use to trap nematodes as they move through the soil.&amp;nbsp; They then eat these nematodes - but instead of ingesting them the way an animal predator would - they digest the worms alive outside the fungal body and absorb the nutrients back over their cell walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kingdom Fungi contains the largest known organism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a Basidiomycete fungus that measures 3.5 miles across and extends an average of three feet into the ground.&amp;nbsp; It is found in eastern Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fungus covers an area as big as 1,665 football fields&amp;nbsp; and is 2400 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a parasite on trees and eventually kills the trees it is associated with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Characteristics of Kingdom Fungi include that they are mainly multicellular (with the exception of the yeasts which are single celled fungi)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are all heterotrophic (specifically chemoheterotrophs) and can be parasitic, a saprobe, or, as we have just seen, predatory. Saprobes are decomposers - they break down already dead organic material whereas parasites feed on living organic material - that is the distinction between a saprobe and a parasite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fungi are what are described as absorptive heterotrophs.&amp;nbsp; They feed by secreting digestive enzymes into their food and then absorb the nutrients into the cells.&amp;nbsp; This is in contrast to the animals which are ingestive heterotrophs - we have to ingest our food and then digest it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fungi have cell walls made of chitin and most of them are nonmotile - meaning they do not have flagellated cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many have a dikaryon state (1N + 1N) -&amp;nbsp; 2 haploid nuclei in same cytoplasmic compartment - the can exist for an extended period of time during the life cycle and it is unique to the fungi.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bodies of multicellular fungi are made up of structures known as hyphae - slender filaments that have a large surface area for secreting digestive enzymes over and absorbing nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some species of fungi can digest cellulose and lignin so they are important recyclers in forest ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this ability also makes them problematic if they start growing in your house and digesting your cellulose-based dry wall and the lignin the wood that holds your house together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyphae can be either septate - when there are walls or septa that divide the hypha, or coenocytic if the hypha is not divided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we look at a mushroom, for example, we are seeing a mass of hyphae collected together into a structure known as a mycelium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This image shows some of the diverse fungi that were found on the Penn State campus in the fall.&amp;nbsp; The bright orange fungus in the center of the slide is commonly referred to as a chicken mushroom and, it might seem strange, is delicious when sauteed with butter and garlic.&amp;nbsp; But remember - only hunt for edible mushrooms with an expert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 9&lt;br&gt;Fungi are involved in some important mutualistic symbiotic relationships.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mycorrhizae are an association between a fungus and plant roots.&amp;nbsp; This relationship is very important in helping plants to survive in the terrestrial environment.&amp;nbsp; The fungus benefits by getting sugars from the plant and the plant benefits by being better able to take up water and nutrients from the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lichen are a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner (a green algae or cyanobacteria)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as with the mycorrhizae - the fungus gets fixed carbon (or sugars) and the photosynthetic partner gets minerals and water. So both of these are mutualistic relationships. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reproduction in the fungi is quite different from other organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, the fungi are haploid throughout most of their life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For another, most fungi can reproduce both sexually and asexually and often only reproduce sexually when stressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the four main groups of fungi produce distinct features during sexual reproduction and these features are used to classify the fungi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the fungal life cycle, there are some vocabulary words you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there are no sexes in the fungi because they do not produce gametes.&amp;nbsp; Instead, the fungi are or of mating types, either + or -.&amp;nbsp; The distinct strains are compatible in sexual reproduction and produce a zygote.&amp;nbsp; In other words, only a + and - can reproduce together - two positives can't reproduce and two negatives can't reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term Plasmogamy refers to the&amp;nbsp; fusion of cytoplasm of two (or more) cells to form either a dikaryon (if two cells fuse) or a heterokaryon (if more than two cells fuse).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term karyogamy refers to the fusion of nuclei during sexual reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During sexual reproduction in the fungi, two haploid mycelia of opposite mating type grow toward each other and during the process of plasmogamy fuse together to produce the dikaryotic stage.&amp;nbsp; The dikaryon is two haploid nuclei in the same cytoplasmic compartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dikaryon then goes through karyogamy - fusion of the nuclei to produce a diploid nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This starts the diploid stage.&amp;nbsp; The diploid stage is typically very brief and meiosis occurs to produce haploid spores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These spores are then released from the parent fungus and germinate into new individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we look at the different groups of fungi - we will see that it is the dikaryon or heterokaryon stage that is unique between the different groups.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Hereditary and Life Cycles Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Hereditary and Life Cycles Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;Meiosis is cell division for reproduction.&amp;nbsp; It is a process by which genetic variation is created and maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During meiosis, one diploid cell give rise to four haploid cells.&amp;nbsp; These resulting haploid cells are genetically different from the original parent cell and from each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of meiosis occurs in two stages - meiosis I and meiosis II. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two important features of meiosis that produce genetic variation - crossing-over during Prophase I of meiosis I and independent assortment of homologous chromsomes during metaphase I of meiosis I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;Most of the important stuff in meiosis occurs in meiosis I.&amp;nbsp; Just as in our study of mitosis, we are not concerned with details about the cell - we just want to understand the movement and behavior of the chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few key events in meiosis that do not occur in mitosis.&amp;nbsp; The first is that the homologous chromosomes synapse or attach to each other during Prophase I - this does not happen in mitosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the homologous chromsomes are physically connected to each other during synapsis, a process known as crossing over takes place.&amp;nbsp; This is a physical exchange of genetic material between non-sister chromatids.&amp;nbsp; This does not happen in mitosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During metaphase I, the synapsed or connected chromosomes line up together along the metaphase plate - this also does not occur during mitosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, during anaphase I, it is the homologous chromosomes that separate - not the sister chromatids as in mitosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;Let's look at the process of crossing-over.&amp;nbsp; During prophase I of meiosis I, the homologous chromosomes pair up and physically connect to each other.&amp;nbsp; During this time, crossing-over takes place.&amp;nbsp; Crossing-over is the physical exchange of DNA between non-sister chromatids.&amp;nbsp; This process results in genetically unique chromosomes.&amp;nbsp; Crossing over is not a mistake or a mutation - it is a part of normal cell division via meiosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;We can look at a diagram of meiosis I (which is also known as reduction division because it is during meiosis I that the ploidy level of the resulting cells is reduced to haploid).&amp;nbsp; In this diagram, we can see the homologous chromosomes pairng and crossing over during prophase I.&amp;nbsp; During metaphase I, the homologous pairs line up at the metaphse plate.&amp;nbsp; And during Anaphase I, the homologous chromsomes separate from each other.&amp;nbsp; This is the reduction event.&amp;nbsp; Remember, in mitosis it is the sister chromatids that separate during anaphase.&amp;nbsp; In meiosis I it is the homologous chromosomes that separate from each other. One member of the pair moves to one pole, and the other member moves to the other pole.&amp;nbsp; During telophase I the cell will divide to produce two haploid cells - there is only one copy of each type of chromosome in the resulting daughter cells.&amp;nbsp; The chromosomes, however, are still in the replicated state.&amp;nbsp; During meiosis II the sister chromatids will separate. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;Meiosis II looks very much like mitosis in a haploid cell.&amp;nbsp; In this diagram, we are seeing meiosis II in the two cells that resulted from meiosis I in the preceeding diagram.&amp;nbsp; Note that there has been no DNA replication between meiosis I and meiosis II.&amp;nbsp; During metaphase II the chromosomes line up at the metaphase plate and during anaphase II the centromeres split and the sister chromatids separate from each other.&amp;nbsp; During telophase II the cells divide and we see the 4 haploid cells that result from a full round of meiosis.&amp;nbsp; Note that the color coding of the chromosomes demonstrates the genetic variation that has been produced - none of the 4 cells has the same genetic makeup.&amp;nbsp; Genetic variation has been generated by meiosis. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;Meiosis produces genetic variation in two ways.&amp;nbsp; The first is crossing over which we have already looked at.&amp;nbsp; The second is a process known as independent assortment.&amp;nbsp; Independent assortment is a bit confusing - you should print out and look closely at the diagram of independent assortment from this tutorial.&amp;nbsp; During metaphase I, the paired homologous chromosomes align along the metaphase plate. How one pair of chromosomes aligns along the plate is independent of how another pair aligns.&amp;nbsp; When the chromosome pairs separate during anaphase I, indpendent assortment occurs.&amp;nbsp; This process results in different combinations of chromosomes and we can use an equation to calculate the different number of combinations.&amp;nbsp; The equation is 2 raised to the nth power where n equals the number of homologous pairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7&lt;br&gt;We can visualize independent assortment with this image from the tutorial.&amp;nbsp; This diagram shows a simple cell with two different homologous pairs of chromosomes.&amp;nbsp; The left side of the diagram shows one possible arrangement of chromosomes and the right the other possible arrangement (the colors indicate different chromosomes - in this diagram let's say that light green is the maternal chromosome - or the chromosome inherited from the female parent and the dark green is paternal - or inherited from the male parent - the same color coding applies to the blue pair - light blue from mom and dark blue from dad). On the left the chromosomes line up on the metaphase plate with the light blue and light green aligned on one side and dark blue and dark green aligned on the other. When the cell goes through meiosis it produces two different types of daughter cells - one type that has both maternal light colored chromosomes and one type that has both paternal dark colored chromsomes.&amp;nbsp; On the right hand side we see that there is another way for the chromosomes to align along the metaphase plate.&amp;nbsp; They can align so that the light green is on the same side as the dark blue and the dark green is on the same side as the light blue.&amp;nbsp; When the cell goes through meiosis, it produces two different types of daughter cells - those with a dark green and light blue chromosome and those with a light green and dark blue chromosome.&amp;nbsp; Overall, this original parent cells with two homologous pairs of chromosomes can produce four different possible types of chromosomes.&amp;nbsp; This is independent assortment and it generates genetic variation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 8&lt;br&gt;So a cell with 2 homologous pairs can produce 4 different possible gamete types.&amp;nbsp; What about humans?&amp;nbsp; We have 23 pairs of chromosomes.&amp;nbsp; How much genetic variation does independent assortment produce in us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 9&lt;br&gt;To answer this question, we need to remember our equation of 2 raised to the nth power where n is the number of homologous pairs.&amp;nbsp; Note: n is the number of pairs - not the total number of chromosomes.&amp;nbsp; In humans, n equals 23.&amp;nbsp; So the total number of chromosome combinations produced by independent assortment in humans is 2 raised to the 23rd power - or number greater than 8 million.&amp;nbsp; This is a lot of genetic variation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 10&lt;br&gt;Our discussion of independent assortment did not include crossing over.&amp;nbsp; When we add crossing over into the picture - meiosis generates even more genetic variation.&amp;nbsp; Essentially, the genetic variation in a population as a result of independent assortment and crossing over is infinite! &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Mitosis VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Mitosis VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;To understand the evolution of life on earth - we must gain an understanding of genetics.&amp;nbsp; To understand genetics, we must understand cell division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two types of cell division in eukaryotic organisms - mitosis and meiosis.&amp;nbsp; We will start by discussing mitosis.&amp;nbsp; Mitosis is cell division that is essentially a cloning process - during mitosis a cell divides and produces two cells that are genetically identical.&amp;nbsp; Mitosis gives rise to two daughter cells that have the same ploidy number as the original parent cell.&amp;nbsp; Ploidy number refers to the number of copies of each type of chromosome - haploid organisms have one copy of each chromosome, diploid organisms have two copies of each chromosome, and triploid organisms have three copies.&amp;nbsp; Most of the organisms that we will be discussing during this course are diploid and have two copies of each chromosome.&amp;nbsp; A diploid cell that goes through mitosis creates two daughter cells that are also diploid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In single-celled organisms, mitosis is used for reproduction.&amp;nbsp; However, we will mainly be looking at multi-cellular organisms and multicellular organisms use mitois for growth and repair of damaged tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;The division of a cell is an aspect of a cell's cycle.&amp;nbsp; In general, the cell cycle is comprised of two main stages - interphase and M-phase.&amp;nbsp; Interphase is the stage in which all of the cell activities other than division take place.&amp;nbsp; The M-phase refers to either mitosis or meiosis and is the stage during which the cell divides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;For this course, you do not need to know details about mitosis other than the movement of the chromosomes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chromosome movement during cell division is key to understanding genetics - our next topic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;Mitosis is a continous process but we can divide the process into stages by looking at key landmarks during cell division. These landmarks are so obvious, they can be seen by using a simple light microscope and a cell stain, as seen in the microscope images at the top of this image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;Interphase is the longest stage in the cell cycle and it is the time when a cell makes the decision to divide.&amp;nbsp; Once the decision to divide has been made, the cell prepares for division.&amp;nbsp; During S-phase of interphase, the chromsomes are replicated.&amp;nbsp; S stands for synthesis and refers to the process of DNA replication which we will learn more about later in the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to chromosome replication, the chromosome is comprised of a single strand.&amp;nbsp; After the chromosome is replicated, the chromosome is comprised of two strands known as sister chromatids.&amp;nbsp; The sister chromatids are identical to each other and they are attached at a location known as a centromere.&amp;nbsp; A replicated chromosome is still considered a single chromsome - but it is a chromosome comprised of two identical sister chromatids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;Remember, as we discuss mitosis we are only focusing on the movement and behavior of the chromosomes.&amp;nbsp; You may have learned mitosis in a previous class and focused on other aspects of cell division such as the behavior of the nuclear envelope or formation of the mitotic spindle.&amp;nbsp; We will not discuss these features during the course.&amp;nbsp; So the one thing you need to know about prophase is that the chromosomes condense into distinct structures (during interphase the chromosomes are diffuse and cannot be observed as distinct structures - they need to condense for cell division to avoid damaging the chromosome).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7&lt;br&gt;During metaphase, the chromosomes line up along the equator of the cell - a region known as the metaphase plate.&amp;nbsp; This is essentially an organizational stage - cell division is a well-orchestrated process and requires careful movement of the chromsomes. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 8&lt;br&gt;During anaphase, the centromere regions of each replicated chromosome splits and each chromatid becomes a distinct chromosome.&amp;nbsp; Remember, the sister chromatids are genetically identical to each other - so two genetically identical sets of chromosomes are separating from each other during this phase.&amp;nbsp; The now-distinct chromosomes move to opposite pole regions of the cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 9&lt;br&gt;During telophase, the last stage of mitosis, the cell prepares to become two new genetically identical cells.&amp;nbsp; A nucleus forms at each pole of the cell.&amp;nbsp; Remember, the chromosomes at each pole used to be sister chromatids and are genetically identical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 10&lt;br&gt;The process of mitosis is completed when cytokinesis takes place.&amp;nbsp; Cytokinesis is the division of the cytoplasm to produce two new distinct cells.&amp;nbsp; Prior to mitosis all of the cell organelles were also being replicted so each new cell has a complete set of organelles and is a complete cell.&amp;nbsp; Mitosis is now complete and our original parent cell has given rise to two new genetically identical daughter cells.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hereditary and Life Cycles Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Hereditary and Life Cycles Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;We started this course by briefly discussing evolution and natural selection.&amp;nbsp; We are now going to revisit these ideas as a way to begin discussing genetics.&amp;nbsp; Remember the definitions of these terms.&amp;nbsp; The term "evolution" is used to refer to genetic changes that take place in populations of organisms over time.&amp;nbsp; The term "natural selection" is used to refer to the differential reproduction that can occur in populations.&amp;nbsp; In other words, within a population some individuals are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass on their genes than other individuals.&amp;nbsp; The individuals that are most likely to survive and reproduce are those individuals with the most beneficial traits.&amp;nbsp; In a drought year in the Galapagos islands, the seeds have a tough seed coat, and those finches with bigger, stronger beaks are more likely to survive and reproduce.&amp;nbsp; The environment is naturally selecting for individuals with larger size beaks and results in the evolution of a population with larger average beak size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural selection is not the only means by which a population can evolve - we will be discussing other mechanisms of evolution later in the course.&amp;nbsp; But natural selection has one very important caveat - it results in populations that are better adapted to their environment than previous generations.&amp;nbsp; This is unique to natural selection and the other mechanisms of evolution do not have this feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;Charles Darwin - the so-called "father of evolution" proposed that in order for natural selection to take place there must be variation in populations - in other words, organisms must be different from each other.&amp;nbsp; He also realized that this variation must be heritable - the variable traits must be passed from parents to offspring.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, even though Darwin did not know about genes or chromosomes or how heredity works, he did realize that there must be an understandable way for parents to pass traits to their offspring. He essentially predicted the field of genetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to understand genetics and evolution, we must understand how genetic variation is generated and maintained in populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;We now understand that natural selection cannot occur without variation.&amp;nbsp; Think back to the example of the seed-eating finches on the Galapagos.&amp;nbsp; During times of drought seed coats become thick and hard to crack.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, the individuals with larger beaks were more likely to survive and reproduce than individuals with smaller beaks.&amp;nbsp; In this environment, natural selection acts on the variation existing in the population and selects the individuals with larger beaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But where does this variation come from?&amp;nbsp; There are two sources of genetic variation in populations - mutation and sexual reproduction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutation is a term that refers to mistakes during the replication of DNA (remember - before a cell divides the chromosomes have to make a copy of themselves - that is DNA replication and mistakes can sometimes occur during this process).&amp;nbsp; This is a relatively rare mechanism for generating variation and we will talk about this more later in the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sexual reproduction is the mechanism that is most responsible for generating variation within populations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;So, what is sex?&amp;nbsp; You probably have an idea of what sex is but you may be surprised at how boring the defintion truly is!&amp;nbsp; Sex refers to the exchange and/or recombination of genetic material.&amp;nbsp; In other words, DNA must be exchanged and recombined.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;This process does not have to be coupled with reproduction - for example, conjugation is an exchange of DNA between bacteria but there is no reproduction - no new individuals are produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sex always produces genetically distinct individuals and the genetic variation results in individuals that are different from&lt;br&gt;each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;Here is an example of sex without reproduction.&amp;nbsp; One bacterium, the one I am circling, is passing DNA to another.&amp;nbsp; Sex has taken place because this individual has new DNA, but there has not been any reproduction.&amp;nbsp; Two individuals started the process of conjugation and two individuals are present at the end - no new individuals have been produced.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, many organisms reproduce without sex.&amp;nbsp; This is known as asexual reproduction and it is a cloning process.&amp;nbsp; It results in offspring that are genetically identical to the parent.&amp;nbsp; Examples of organisms that reproduce asexually are paramecium which produce offspring through a process known as fission or hydra which produce offspring through budding.&amp;nbsp; In both cases, the offspring are genetically identical to the parent individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7&lt;br&gt;Asexual reproduction is a cloning process - a clone is genetically identical to the original individual.&amp;nbsp; We tend to discuss cloning as something that is done in a scientific laboratory but cloning has been happening in nature for billions of years and you may have cloned an organism.&amp;nbsp; If you have ever taken a spider baby off a parent spider plant and rooted it to form a new plant - you have cloned an organism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 8&lt;br&gt;To&amp;nbsp; understand the inheritance of traits, we need to understand chromosomes - the structures on which genes are located.&amp;nbsp; We will be looking at mainly diploid organisms in this course - diploid organisms have two copies of each chromosome.&amp;nbsp; These pairs of chromosomes are called homologous chromosomes.&amp;nbsp; Homologous chromosomes have the same size, shape and sequence of genes - as seen in this image of a homologous pair of chromosome from a pea plant.&amp;nbsp; In a diploid organism, one member of the pair is inherited from the mother and one from the father.&amp;nbsp; While homologous chromsomes have the same genes, they can have different alleles.&amp;nbsp; Alleles are variants of genes.&amp;nbsp; In this diagram, the gene is the gene for flower color in pea plants and the alleles are purple versus white.&amp;nbsp; It is the different alleles that are responsible for the genetic variation in populations.&amp;nbsp; In pea plants, some individuals have purpler flowers and some have white.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 9&lt;br&gt;To understand how parents pass traits to offspring - let's look at this diagram of sexual reproduction in a typical animal - humans.&amp;nbsp; This concept should be familiar to you but let's look at the details. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In humans, women produce eggs (which are haploid) and men produce sperm (which are also haploid).&amp;nbsp; During sex a sperm fertilizes an egg to produce a zygote (which is diploid).&amp;nbsp; The zygote divides via mitosis to produce a multicellular individual which eventually matures into an adult.&amp;nbsp; The type of cell division that produces the sperm and egg is meiosis. Meiosis is similar to mitosis but it has some important differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 10&lt;br&gt;Remember that mitosis is a cloning process - when a cell goes through mitosis it produces two daughter cells that are genetically identical to the original parent cell.&amp;nbsp; Meiosis, on the other hand, is a reductional division - it produces daughter cells that have half the ploidy-level (or number of chromsomes) as the original parent cell.&amp;nbsp; So in the sexual life cycle of a human, the parent cells are diploid but meiosis produces haploid gametes (sperm and eggs).&amp;nbsp; Fertilization then restores the diploid number.&amp;nbsp; A sexual life cycle involves an alternation between haploid gametes and diploid cells.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Protists II Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;The red algae belong to Kingdom Rhodophyta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These organisms are multicellular photosynthetic seaweeds with no flagellated cells.&amp;nbsp; The most distinct distinguishing characteristic is the presence of special photosynthetic pigments known as phycobilins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These phycobilins are a red pigment and give the red algae their red color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phycobilins are specialized to absorb blue wavelengths of light and blue light penetrates deeper into water.&amp;nbsp; This allows the red algae to grow at deeper depths than other photosynthetic organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the coralline algae, which secrete calcium carbonate and play a major role in building coral reefs are members of the Rhodophyta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;The red algae are a large group with an estimated 10,000 different species.&amp;nbsp; Some of them are large and plant-like while others are small and grow on the surface of other organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;Red algaes are used extensively in food production and industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agar is a gelatinous substance that is derived from algae.&amp;nbsp; It is used to make gel tablets for pills, as a cosmetic base, as culture medium for microbiology labs to grow bacteria and other microscopic organisms, and for making jellies and desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red algae are eaten regularly in many parts of the world - including the nori sheets that wrap around sushi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a food label reader you have probably seen the ingredient carageenan listed on an ice cream or yogurt container.&amp;nbsp; Carageenan is stabilizer that is made from red algae and helps keep ice cream and yogurt creamy.&amp;nbsp; It is also used in cosmetics and paints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;Our last group of protists are the green algae or chlorophyta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This group will get special attention because it is the group of organisms that gave rise to the true plants of Kingdom Plantae. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The green algae have chloroplasts and they use both chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b.&amp;nbsp; Chlorophyll occurs in several basic forms - including chlorophyll a - which is used by all photosynthetic organisms and chlorophyll b which is used only by the plants and green algae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the presence of chlorophyll b in the green algae and plants that indicates their close evolutionary relatedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other features they share with plants is that they store their carbohydrates as starch and, if a cell wall is present, it is made of cellulose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also exhibit alternation of generation which is seen in all plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The green algae can be either unicellular or multicellular and there is a great diversity in their forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;This image shows some of the diversity of size and form in this kingdom.&amp;nbsp; The top images are microscope images and the bottom images are of larger green algae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;The green algae Acetabularia is a single-celled organism, but it is gigantic in size and complex in form so it is an excellent model organism for studying cell biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An individual cell is usually about 5 centimeters tall with a cup about 1 cm across - there are not many cells that can be seen with the naked eye!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of its appearance - it is sometimes called Mermaid's chalice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;Some green algae are terrestrial and can survive in quite dry environments by living symbiotically with a fungus.&amp;nbsp; These symbiotic relationships are called lichens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lichens are composite organisms consisting of a symbiotic association of a fungus with a photosynthetic partner either a green alga or a cyanobacterium.&amp;nbsp; They often live on rocks or the bark of trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lichens are often the first organisms to settle in places lacking soil, constituting the sole vegetation in some extreme environments such as those found at high mountain elevations and at high latitudes. Some survive in the tough conditions of deserts, and others on frozen soil of the Arctic regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Space Agency has even discovered that lichens can survive unprotected in space!&lt;/p&gt;</body>

&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;As we continue our discussion of the protists, it is important to remember that the taxonomy of protists is still changing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newer classifications attempt to present monophyletic groups based on ultrastructure, biochemistry, and genetics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial we will discuss the stramenopilans, the chlorophytes, and the rhodophytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;Kingdom Stramenopila is a diverse group of organisms - some are photosynthetic and plant-like (these are the diatoms, golden algae, and brown algae - you can tell they are plant-like by the suffix phyta).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other group - the water molds is heterotrophic and fungus-like (the suffix mycota means fungus-like).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the diversity of these organisms, Kingdom Stramenopila is thought to be monophyletic and the diagnostic characteristic of these organisms is the presene of hair-like projects (known as stramen) on their flagella.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;Phlym Bacillariophyta or the Diatoms consists of single-celled individuals that have an elaborate silica shell.&amp;nbsp; Most of the diatoms are photosynthetic and they are found in virtually all environments - aquatic and terrestrial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be as many as 100,000 different species of diatoms and they are important components of plankton.&amp;nbsp; As a group, they may be responsible for 20% of the global CO2 fixation - in other words, 20% of the photosynthesis ocurring on earth is the result of diatoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;You can see here some of the beautiful and intricate shells made by diatoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;There are practical uses for diatoms and their fossilized remains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diatomaceous earth is the remains of fossilized diatoms, their silica shells give it an abrasive quality&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diatomaceous earth is used to make scouring powders, toothpastes, cat litter, and mechanical pesticides&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diatoms are also being used in nanotechnology studies - the goal is to get diatoms to produce silica structures to be used in optical systems, semiconductors, and use as a drug delivery system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;Our next group is the golden algae or Chrysophyta.&lt;br&gt;Most of these organisms are photosynthetic and they use a pigment known as fucoxanthin during photosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do not need to know the name of this pigment but I want&amp;nbsp; you to recogize that chlorophyll is not the only photosynthetic pigment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the golden algae can turn heterotrophic when the environmental conditions are right.&amp;nbsp; This is known as being facultatively heterotrophic or a mixotroph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This group is an important component of food webs mainly in freshwater systems such as lakes.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7&lt;br&gt;Phylum Oomycota is comprised of organisms knows as water molds, downy mildews, and rusts).&amp;nbsp; As you can probably tell from these common names - these organisms are fungus-like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most members of this group are multicellular and they live in both terrestrial and aquatic environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are all heterotrophic - the feed on complex organic molecules by asborbing them - this is the same way that the fungi feed.&amp;nbsp; And like the fungi they are either decomposers - which means that they decompose already dead organic material - or they are parasites - which means they decompose living organic material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They appear similar to the fungi not because they are closely related to the fungi - they are not.&amp;nbsp; But rather because of convergent evolution. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two features that let us know that they are not related to the fungi is that the oomycota have cell walls made of cellulose while fungi have cell walls made of chitin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are also diploid for most of their life cycle while fungi are haploid.&amp;nbsp; We will learn more about the fungi in future tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 8&lt;br&gt;The oomycota are important parasites.&amp;nbsp; Some of the aquatic forms cause diseases in fish and amphibians.&amp;nbsp; If you have a fish tank - you have probably had to treat your fish for an oomycete infection - they are common in stagnat water like that found in fish tanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phytophthora infestans is the organism which causes late blight of potato. The potato is native to North America, but once it was introduced to Europe, it quickly became an important food crop.&lt;br&gt;Late blight did not follow its host plant across the Atlantic until much later; the disease organism grows into the stem and leaf tissues, causing death, and may also infest the tubers, which are the part of the plant that is eaten.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disease spreads rapidly under cool and damp conditions, which are common in western Europe. In one week during the summer of 1846, this diease wiped out almost the entire potato crop of Ireland, a crop which was the primary food of the poor at that time. Nearly a million Irish died in the Great Famine, and an additional one-and-a-half million emigrated to other countries, including America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 10&lt;br&gt;Our final group of stramenopilans are the Brown algae or phaeophyta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a group of organisms that are found in marine environments and includes the organisms we usually refer to as seaweeds or kelps.&amp;nbsp; They make up the kelp forests off the coast of southern California and other parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a multicellular group of organisms and some of them get quite large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, these organisms show tissue differentiation.&amp;nbsp; This is the first group of organisms we have looked at that have had this feature.&amp;nbsp; Tissue differentiation means that they have specialized tissues for carrying out specialized funcations.&amp;nbsp; All the other organisms we have looked at thus far have either been unicellular or mutlticellular with a very simple body plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bodies of the seaweeds show differentiation into holdfasts, stipes and blades.&amp;nbsp; Holdfasts are similar to plant roots - they anchor the seaweed to the ocean floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stipes are similar to the stems of plants and the blades are similar to the leaves of plants.&amp;nbsp; Some of the brown algae even have conducting tissue which moves sugars produced via photosynthesis in the blades to other parts of the organism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These brown algae look very plant like - but closer evaluation reveals this as another example of convergent evolution.&amp;nbsp; Brown algae and plants appear similar but this similarity is due to similar selection pressues not evolutionary relatedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 11&lt;br&gt;This image gives you an idea of how large some of the brown algae can become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also see the holdfast, stipes, and blades (labelled here as laminae because they are thin).&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Protists I Part 3 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Protists I Part 3 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;Kingdom Alveolata is a monophyletic kingdom comprised of three main groups of organisms - the ciliates, dinoflagellates, and apicomplexans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will see that these three groups of organisms are quite different from each other but this is still considered to be a monophyletic kingdom because all three share a common diagnostic characteristic - the presence of structures known as alveoli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alveoli are small cavities enclosed in membranes that hug the internal cell surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;The Ciliates are a group of free-living organisms that are covered with cilia which are small hair-like structures. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common representative of this group that you may have seen in a previous biology class are the paramercia - common inhabitants of pond water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ciliates are heterotrophic and they eat bacteria and other protists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They make up an important part of the food chain in freshwater systems but they are not known to cause significant problems for humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;The dinoflagellates are a large and ecologically and economically significant group of organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have two flagella that they use for locomotion and they can have very complex life cycles. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some are free-living and photosynthetic and some are parasites of other organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most obviously distinguishing characteristic of this group are the presence of cellulose plates that give the organisms an armored appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;You can see some of these complex cell structures here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;Dinoflagellates are an ecologically important group that are found in both marine and freshwater systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many are photosynthetic and thus form the base of aquatic food webs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some photosynthetic forms live within other organisms such as the zooxanthellae dinoflagellates that live in coral reefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some are parasitic within marine animals and cause significant economic damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some dinoflagellates are bioluminescent and luminesce when disturbed as seen in this picture here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;The term plankton refers to organisms living on the surface of bodies of water.&amp;nbsp; This plankton can be comprised of bacteria, protists and small animals such as this small species of shrimp known as krill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plankton is hugely important for forming the base of the food chain in aquatic systems.&amp;nbsp; To give you an idea of the amount of calories that are found in this plankton we can look at the example of the basking shark.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basking sharks are huge animals - up to 33 feet long.&amp;nbsp; They are not the scary carnivores we tend to think of when we think of sharks.&amp;nbsp; They eat only plankton - and they feed by filtering the plankton through their large mouths with special filtering structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7&lt;br&gt;The plant-like component of plankton is known as phytoplankton.&amp;nbsp; This is the photosynthetic component of plankton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecologically phytoplankton is important for not only playing a role in food chains but also for its role in global carbon dioxide levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon dioxide is an important so called "greenhouse gas" and it plays role in heat retention in the earth's atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some photosynthetic dinoflagellates can experience population "blooms" and produce potent neurotoxins that can poison food webs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 8&lt;br&gt;Red tides occur when dinoflagellate populations expand rapidly or "bloom".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this happens the dinoflagellates can produce neurotoxins that can get taken up into the food chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, shellfish (bivalves) feed (by filtration) on these dinoflagellates and the shellfish concentrate the toxins their tissues.&amp;nbsp; If a person eats these contaminated shellfish it results in a condition known as paralytic shellfish poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These neurotoxins can also accumulate in fish and result in a similar paralytic condition known as Ciguatera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 9&lt;br&gt;As an example of the complexity of the life cycles of some of these organisms we can look at a suggested life cycle for an organism know as Pfiesteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a controversial organism that has been blamed for massive fish dies offs off the coast of North Carolina.&amp;nbsp; There is a video posted on ANGEL that explains the controversy around this organism and is a nice case study on the nature of science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 10&lt;br&gt;Our final group of alveolates are the apicomplexans.&amp;nbsp; This is a group of heterotrophic parasites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have no known means of locomotion and are spread from one host to another as the result of the movement of other organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distinguishing characteristic of this group is a structure known as an apical complex - which is a dense structure that helps the organism gain entry into a host cell during infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the organisms in this group are parasites on invertebrates and we even use some of them to help control insect populations in agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one member of this group, however, that is of huge importance to humans and this is an organism known as plasmodium that causes the disease malaria.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 11&lt;br&gt;Malaria is spread through mosquito bites and plasmodium is an example of an organism with a complex life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 12&lt;br&gt;Not all species of mosquitos spread malaria - the Anopheles mosquito that is now found mainly in equatorial Africa is the vector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, an estimated 190 - 311 million cases of malaria occurred worldwide and 708,000 - 1,003,000 people died, most of them young children in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control efforts have focused on mosquito control but mosquitoes have evolved resistance to many pesticides&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efforts to develop a vaccine have had limited success to date but there is still hope that a vaccine will be developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, there are low tech and relatively inexpensive means to control the spread of the mosquitoes and thus the disease.&amp;nbsp; Bed nets are an example of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 13&lt;br&gt;Nothing But Nets is an effort which brings together multimedia organizations, professional sports leagues, faith-based and civil society organizations, corporations, and foundations to raise funds to send bed nets to sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bed nets can be an effective low tech tool&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Protists I Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Protists I Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;Kingdom Euglenozoa is a monophyletic group of flagellated organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure of these flagella is complex so to fill in the diversity chart on ANGEL - you just need to know that these organisms have flagella as their distinguishing characteristic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the euglenozoa are free living and photosynthetic and some are important parasites of humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main groups of organisms in this kingdom.&amp;nbsp; The euglenoids and the kinetoplastids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;The Eugleniods are mainly photosynthetic and live in freshwater. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These organisms are believed to have evolved from an ancestor that took up a green algae by a secondary endosymbiosis.&amp;nbsp; Endosymbiosis, as we have previously learned, is a common theme in evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;The second group of Euglenzoa are the kinetoplastids.&amp;nbsp; These organisms are distinguished by the presence of a kinetoplast, a DNA-containing granule located within the single mitochondrion associated with the base of the cell's flagella.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are important human parasites and causes disease such as African sleeping sickness and Chagas disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleeping sickness occurs only in 36 sub-Saharan Africa countries where there are tsetse flies that can transmit the disease.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people most exposed to the tsetse fly and therefore the disease are in rural populations dependent on agriculture, fishing, animal husbandry or hunting.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After continued control efforts, the number of cases reported in 2009 has dropped below 10,000 for first time in 50 years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis and treatment of the disease is complex and requires specifically skilled staff.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;Chagas disease occurs mainly in rural Mexico, Central America, and South America&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transmitted by insects commonly referred to as "kissing bugs".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affects 8-10 million people/year and ~20,000 people/year die&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treatment options exist but resistance to the drugs is evolving in the kinetoplastid organisms.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Protists I Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Protists I Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;As we discuss the biological diversity found on earth - it is useful to take a historical look at our understanding of biodiversity and the evolutionary relationships between organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darwin envisioned the history of life on earth as a tree, as he sketched here in one of his notebooks. This tree shows the recognition that all life on earth shares a common ancestor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The branches on the tree reflect groups of organisms and until fairly recently all organisms were grouped into 5 kingdoms - kingdoms animalia, plantae, fungi, bacteria (also known as monera), and kingdom protista which included most of the single-celled eukaryotic organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you learned in the introduction to the prokaryotes - this 5 kingdom system is outdated and we know classify organisms into three domains - the bacteria and the archaebacteria - which we have already looked at - and eukarya which includes all of the eukaryotes. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;A modern tree of life is much more complicated than anything Darwin ever imagined.&amp;nbsp; The number of different species on earth is immense but one aspect of this tree that is the same as Darwin's tree is the recognition that all life shares a common ancestor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;As we have learned more about the different types of organisms - the tree of life has become more complicated.&amp;nbsp; This is due, in part, to the fact that what used to be the kingdom Protista has now been broken down into a number of kingdoms.&amp;nbsp; This reflects the fact that the organisms that were all grouped into kingdom Protista do not all share a most recent common ancestor or shared characteristics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;To understand why kingdom Protista was split into multiple kingdoms - we need to understand more about how classification systems are developed and there are some terms that need to be defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term paraphyletic refers to a group that does not include all of the descendents of a common ancestor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, protists are paraphyletic because animals, plants and fungi arose from within protists but are not included in the group.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term monophyletic refers to a group containing all of the descendants of a common ancestor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the alveolates are monophyletic and are distinguished by the presence of small cavities just beneath the plasma membrane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term polyphyletic refers to a group which, through convergent evolution, contains individuals with similar characteristics but who have different ancestors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, previous classification of the protists grouped them as animal-like, plant-like, fungal-like - based on convergence of ecology, not true evolutionary relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of developing a classification system is to base it on monophyletic groupings.&amp;nbsp; Paraphyletic groupings and polyphyletic groupings do not accurately reflect the evolutionary relationships between different organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;Convergent evolution is the evolution of species from different taxonomic groups toward a similar form; the development of similar characteristics by taxonomically different organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This illustration shows an example of convergent evolution in four different animals from around the globe. They may look similar, but it's not because they're close relatives. Instead, they've evolved similar adaptations because they occupy similar niches -- dining on ants, hunting in the high grass, or swimming in the dark -- although their evolutionary origins are quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;All of the protists were originally grouped together into a single kingdom in large part because they superficialy appeared similar as a result of convergent evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now recognize that splitting the protists into multiple kingdoms makes more evolutionary sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This area of study has not been settled so the classification system that we are going to discuss has not been agreed upon by all biologists. However, we will be discussing the archaezoa, the euglenozoa, the alveolata, the stramenopilans, the chlorophyta, and the rhodophyta.&amp;nbsp; I will use the term protists casually to describe these organisms but recognize that this term does not have any real biological meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7&lt;br&gt;The first group of organisms that we will be looking at are those that have modified mitochondria.&amp;nbsp; These organisms used to be grouped together in a kingdom called Archaezoa - but we have since learned that there are significant differences between the members of this group and the Kingdom was not monophyletic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main groups of organisms with highly modified or missing mitochondria.&amp;nbsp; The diplomonads and the parabasalids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 8&lt;br&gt;The diplomonads have relic mitochondria but these modified mitochondria do not have an Electron transport chain and thus do not play a role in cellular respiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These organisms are anaerobic (not having an electron transport chain means they have no need for oxygen) and they are recognized because they have two haploid nuclie and four flagella which gives them a face-like appearance. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most well-known representative of this group is the organism Giardia which is a parasite that lives in freshwater and, if ingested, causes severe intestinal distress.&amp;nbsp; Giardia is one important reason you want to filter your water if you drink from a stream or lake while you are hiking or camping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, scientists sequenced the genome of this organism and discovered that it makes several unique proteins that its animal hosts do not make.&amp;nbsp; These proteins may be a promising target of drugs to treat the infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 9&lt;br&gt;The parabasalids are a group of flagellated single-celled organisms, most of which are symbiotic in animals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These include a variety of forms found in the guts of termites and cockroaches, many of which have symbiotic bacteria that help them digest wood. Some other species are human pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parabasalids are anaerobic, and lack mitochondria, but this is now known to be a result of secondary loss, and they contain small hydrogenosomes which apparently developed from reduced mitochondria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The function of the hydrogenosome is to help the anaerobic organism produce ATP from pyruvate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parabasalids in the genus Trichonympha are particularly well studied because of their role in the guts of insects such as termites.&amp;nbsp; These organisms use endosymbiotic bacteria to help them digest cellulose. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Subcellular Architecture Part 3 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;The endosymbiotic theory states that mitochondria and chloroplasts are derived from endosymbiotic bacteria that were engulfed by a larger cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria most likely arose from Rickettsiales (bacteria that are mainly known to live as endosymbionts - modern day representatives of these bacteria cause typhus and Rocky Mountain spotted fever)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chloroplasts from cyanobacteria (photosynthetic bacteria)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;The evidence for endosymbiosis includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That mitochondria and chloroplasts have a circular DNA "chromosome" that is the same size as a typical bacterial genome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also have two membranes - an and outer that resulted from being engulfed by a larger cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria and chloroplasts divide by binary fission just like bacteria do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In eukaryotic cells, nuclear DNA contains genes that probably came from proto-mitochondria and proto-plastids&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some proteins that are encoded in the nucleus are transported to mitochondria and chloroplasts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the Ribosomes of mitochondria and chloroplasts are bacteria-like - unlike the ribosomes found in the rest of the eukaryotic cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;Biologists have been able to observe endosymbiosis in the lab.&amp;nbsp; Discovered in 2006, Hatena arenicola is an organism believed to be in the process of an endosybiosis.&amp;nbsp; It is a eukaryote that behaves like a heterotrophic predator - until it ingests a certain species of green algae and then it becomes an autotroph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;Endosymbionts occur all throughout the world.&amp;nbsp; The guts of termites are whacky places full of all kinds of strange organisms - both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trichonympha - for example - helps termites to digest cellulose.&amp;nbsp; However, they require bacterial endosymbionts to produce the enzyme that digest celluose.&amp;nbsp; Without the bacterial endosymbiont they cannot digest cellulose.&amp;nbsp; They also have bacterial endosymbionts that function as flagella and help the organism move through its environment. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixotricha is equally as strange.&amp;nbsp; It also has bacterial endosymbionts that help it digest cellulose and function as flagella in motility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has additional bacterial endosymbionts that function as mitochondria - because mixotricha do not have their own mitochondria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our current secretary of energy Steven Chu is a nobel-prize winning physicist who believes the termite gut may provide insight into alternative energy sources.&amp;nbsp; When these organisms digest celluose they produce ethanol - ethanol that can be used as a biofuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evolution of eukaryotic cells via endosymbiosis implies that there was a selective advantage to this relationship.&amp;nbsp; As an example, we will look at the evolution of the relationship that resulted in mitochondria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the evolution of this relationship we need to remember that conditions on early earth were very different than they are now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 3.5 billion years ago cyanobacteria were polluting the atmosphere with oxygen - oxygen is a by-product of the photosynthesis that was being performed by the cyanobacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2 BYA the atmosphere was becoming aerobic-how could obligate anaerobes survive this toxic environment?&amp;nbsp; Remember, many organisms are poisoned by oxygen so in an increasingly aerobic environment these organisms needed to find a way to protect themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer was to get rid of oxygen by converting the oxygen to water - remember, this is what happens at the end of the electron transport chain in the mitochondria - oxygen is reduced to water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primitive eukaryotes formed symbioses with prokaryotes to protect themselves from the effects of oxygen.&amp;nbsp; This increased the fitness of the primitive eukaryote due to the detoxification of oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the ancestral function of the mitochondrion was to detoxify oxygen in the environment.&amp;nbsp; Today the&lt;br&gt;more derived function of the mitochondrion is energy transduction - converting the energy of the electrons found in the NADH and FADH2 produced by glycolysis and the krebs cycle to energy in the form of ATP.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Subcellular Architecture Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;Cells have an internal support system known as the cytoskeleton.&amp;nbsp; This skeletal system also plays a role in moving substances around the inside of the cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;The smallest cytoskeletal fibers are microfilaments made of contractile protein known as actin.&lt;br&gt;Microfilaments play a critical role in cell motility such as amoeboid movement - the streaming-type movement seen in amoeba and also seen in our white blood cells in our immune system.&amp;nbsp; I have posted a video on ANGEL of a white blood cell engulfing a bacterium - this is possible because of the microfilaments in the cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microfilaments also play an important role in muscle contractions along with a protein known as myosin.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;Intermediate filaments are somewhat larger than microfilaments, yet smaller than microtubules. Intermediate filaments are made of fibrous proteins wrapped around one another to form a thick, cable-like structure. Intermediate filaments play an important role in supporting cell structures and anchoring organelles in the correct position within the cell.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;Microtubules are the largest cytoskeletal elements that we will discuss.&amp;nbsp; Microtubules are actually hollow tubes consisting of rows of paired tubulin molecules. Microtubules play a structural role in the cell but they also play an important role in the movement of substances around the cell.&amp;nbsp; For example, microtubules help move the chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis.&amp;nbsp; Microtubules also help move vesicles around the inside of the cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see this elaborate movement in the "Life of the Cell" video posted on ANGEL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;Lysosomes are vesicles that contain digestive or hydrolytic&amp;nbsp; enzymes.&amp;nbsp; These are enzymes that help to break down materials within the cell.&amp;nbsp; The lysosomes play a role in digestion of food particles, destruction of bacteria and viruses in our immune system, and the breakdown of cellular materials to maintain normal concentrations within our cells. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;When there are problems with subcellular structures - disease can result.&amp;nbsp; A tragic example of this is the genetic disease Tay-sachs.&amp;nbsp; Tay sachs is a recessive genetic condition that results in a nonfunctional lysosomal enzyme being produced.&amp;nbsp; This enzymes normal role is to break down lipids in the brain.&amp;nbsp; In a person with Tay Sachs - this enzyme does not function and the lipids build up in the brain and destroy nerve cell function.&amp;nbsp; There is no cure for this disease and the affected individual dies in childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7&lt;br&gt;Vacuoles are large membrane bound sacs that play a role in storage of materials within the cell.&amp;nbsp; Plant cells have a very large cenral vacuole - seen here - that stores water to maintain structural support sort of like a water balloon.&amp;nbsp; These vacuoles can also house toxins, pigments, and starches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animal cells often do not have vacuoles - but liver cells have vacuoles for the storage of glycogen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-celled protists often have vacuoles for storing and processing food and they typically have contractile vacuoles for pushing water out of their cell.&amp;nbsp; Most single-celled protists live in fresh water - so osmosis is constantly causing water to flow into their cell over the cell membrane.&amp;nbsp; If they did not expel this water - they would explode like an over-filled water ballon.&amp;nbsp; The contractile vacuole pushes excess water out of the cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 8&lt;br&gt;This image shows a contractile vacuole in a paramecium.&amp;nbsp; At the top the vacuole is filling with water that is flowing into the cell - a system of canals leadds the water to the vacuole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it is full - the vacuole contracts and forces the water back out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Subcellular Architecture Part 1 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;Eukaryotic cells are highly compartmentalized cells - this is in comparison to prokaryotic cells which lack the subcellular specialization that we see in the eukaryotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This compartmentalization seen in the eukaryotes is the result of an internal membrane system - eukaryotes have not only a cell membrane but a nuclear membrane and a number of membrane-bound organelles. These structures play important roles in the normal functioning of cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;We will start our tour of the cell with the nucleus.&amp;nbsp; When you look at a cell under a simple light microscope - the nucleus is usually the only structure you can clearly see.&amp;nbsp; In this image, we see the nuclei of onion cells stained blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;The nucleus houses the majority of the DNA in a cell (remember there is also DNA in the mitochondria and chloroplasts of cells).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA replication takes place in the nucleus before a cell divides and transcription of a gene into mRNA takes place in the nucleus during protein synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nucleus also houses a structure known as the nucleolus - the nucleolus is the structure that produces the ribosomal RNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important feature of the nucleus and other membrane bound organelles is that there are pores in the membrane.&amp;nbsp; These pores allow molecules to move in and out of the nucleus.&amp;nbsp; Remember the mRNA has to leave the nucleus and travel to the ribosomes and other molecules have to move into the nucleus to help regulate gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;Once the mRNA leaves the nucleus - it travels to a ribosome so translation can take place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two basic types of ribosomes - free and bound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free ribosomes are ribosomes that are suspended in the cyoplasm of the cell and not anchored to the endoplasmic reticulum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bound ribosomes are bound to the rough endoplasmic reticulum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The free ribosomes produce proteins that are going to stay inside the cell while the bound ribosomes make proteins that are going to be exported outside of the cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ribosomes are in constant movement and what was once a free ribosome can become a bound ribosome and then become a free ribosome again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;The system of membrane bound organelles within a eukaryotic cell is known as the endomembrane system.&amp;nbsp; it include the nucleus, the endoplasmic reticulum, the golgi apparatus, the lysosomes, and the cell membrane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The endoplamic reticulum is series of membranous spaces that is either rough or smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rough endoplasmic reticulum is rough because it is studded with ribosomes.&amp;nbsp; Its job is to make proteins for export outside of the cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smooth endoplamic reticulum is smooth because there are no ribosomes attached.&amp;nbsp; Its job is to help synthesize some fats and lipids.&amp;nbsp; It also plays a very important role in helping us detoxify toxins in our body.&amp;nbsp; The cells of the liver have a great deal of smooth ER.&amp;nbsp; When you take a tylenol or drink alchohol - the smooth ER in your liver metabolizes the active compounds in these substances and helps your body flush them out.&amp;nbsp; Overdosing on the active ingredient in tylenol - acetaminophen -&amp;nbsp; is the number one cause of liver failure in the United States.&amp;nbsp; People often don't recognize that cold medications and cough syrups also have acetaminophen and it can be easy to take too much and overload the smooth ERs ability to detoxify it and remove it from the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;When the rough ER makes a protein for export from the cell - the cell must have a way to recognize it as an export protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is achieved through a process known as protein targeting.&amp;nbsp; Protein targeting is achieved because newly synthesized proteins that are destined for export from the cell have a unique signal sequence that directs them to the rough endoplasmic reticulum.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a growing polypeptide with this signal sequence is being built at a ribosome (and notice - it is starts out being built by a free ribosome) then a signal recognition particle (SRP) binds to the growing polypeptide.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SRP helps to move the ribosome to the rough ER and the whole complex docks at a pore in the RER.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growing polypeptide is then inserted through the pore and translation continues - note that the ribosome is now a bound ribosome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final polypeptide is now inside the RER and it is on its way to being exported to the outside of the cell.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7&lt;br&gt;From the RER, the polypeptide will move to the golgi apparatus.&amp;nbsp; While inside the golgi - the protein will be modified by having sugars added to it.&amp;nbsp; This is a process known as glycolysation.&amp;nbsp; This process of glycolysation is essentially packaging and labeling the protein for export.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 8&lt;br&gt;From the golgi apparatus the protein will be packaged into a vesicle.&amp;nbsp; This vesicle will either travel to the cell membrane and fuse with the membrane thus releasing the protein to the outside of the cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or it will travel to a lysosome and deliver enzymes to the lysosome - we will learn more about this later.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Overview What is Life VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Overview What is Life VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slide 1:&amp;nbsp; As you have just read, Biology is the study of life.&amp;nbsp; But what is life?&amp;nbsp; Defining life can be challenging - we often depict life using an image like you see here: a tree of life.&amp;nbsp; In this image, the base of the tree (which I have just circled) is an ancestor to all of the organisms found at the tips of the branches.&amp;nbsp; Trees like this can be relatively simple like the tree here - a simple tree of eukaryotic life. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slide 2:&amp;nbsp; Or these trees can be rather complex - like the tree you see here.&amp;nbsp; This is a tree that was generated by Biologist David Hillis at the University of Texas.&amp;nbsp; This image shows the relationships of about 3000 different species and these organisms have been classified based on genetic similarity.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This classification system results in all of the animals being put in one group, plants in another group, fungi in a group, and all of the protists in a group - those are the eukaryotic organisms.&amp;nbsp; And this diagram also shows all of the bacteria and archaebacteris which are prokaryotic organisms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slide 3:&amp;nbsp; This image also includes humans in the red circle which says "You are Here".&amp;nbsp; Because all living things share a common ancestor, this image shows them in the middle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slide 4:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Because all organisms share a common ancestor they also share some common features.&amp;nbsp; For example, all organisms have the ability to reproduce and grow, have metabolism (which is the collection of chemical reactions that occurs inside an organisms cells to maintain life), all organisms maintain homeostasis (a relatively stable internal environment), and all organisms have the ability to respond to their external environment (stimuli).&amp;nbsp; For example, to turn toward or away from sunlight. Another commonality of life is that all living things are acted upon by natural selection.&amp;nbsp; And through natural selection organisms are able to adapt to their environment in successive generations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slide 5:You have most likely heard the terms "evolution" and "natural selection" by perhaps you have not stopped to think about the real definitions of these terms.&amp;nbsp; Do these terms mean the same thing?&amp;nbsp; Or do they have distinct meanings?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slide 6:&amp;nbsp; The answer to this question is "Yes".&amp;nbsp; Natural selection and evolution are distinct concepts - they do not have the same meaning.&amp;nbsp; Evolution is a term that refers to the change in a population's genetic structure over time.&amp;nbsp; So if we see a population of organisms getting larger over time - that is an example of evolution because there are genes that contribute to body size and as the genes for body size increase in frequency in the population that is a change in the genetic structure of that population.&amp;nbsp; This definition of evolution will become more clear when we discuss genetics later in the course.&amp;nbsp; Natural selection on the other hand, is one means by which evolution can occur.&amp;nbsp; We will look at other mechanisms of evolution later on in the course but for now we will focus on natural selection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slide 7: Natural selection is a process by which a population becomes adapted to an environment over time.&amp;nbsp; And we can even be more succinct in our description of natural selection&amp;nbsp; and define it as differential reproduction. What this means is that individuals that are better adapted to their environment are better able to survive, reproduce, and pass on their traits (their genes) to the next generation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slide 8:&amp;nbsp; We can see an example of evolution via natural selection by looking at a population of finches on the Galapagos islands.&amp;nbsp; These are the finches made famous by Darwin when he found them on the Galapagos islands and wrote about them in the "Origin of Species".&amp;nbsp; The particular species we will look at is known as Geospiza fortus.&amp;nbsp; This species lives on Daphne Major and during the years 1976-1978 this island experienced a severe drought.&amp;nbsp; The image is not very clear, and you are not responsible for the details of the image, but appreciate the general story.&amp;nbsp; What we see is that the population of finches declined dramatically and the reason is because there was also a decline in food supply (seeds).&amp;nbsp; The population of seeds declined as a result of the drought.&amp;nbsp; The drought meant that the plants were not able to produce as many seeds and the seeds that they did produce became harder and thicker.&amp;nbsp; So the overall size and thickness of the seed coat increased during the drought.&amp;nbsp; In response to that increase in seed coat thickness, the birds that did survive the drought became larger because larger birds were able to crack the seed coats of the thicker seeds.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Individuals that were likely to survive during the drought were the larger individuals and the overall average size of the birds increased during the drought. And this is an example of evolution because body size is controlled by genes but natural selection (or differential reproduction) is causing the evolution.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Larger finches are better able to access larger harder seeds so they are better able to get food and energy for reproduction and they then pass those genes on to their offspring.&amp;nbsp; The population overall becomes larger and this is a nice example of evolution that is often used in textbooks because it is such a nice example. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slide 9: Natural selection and evolution will be recurring themes in this course.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</body>

    <title>Expression of Multiple Alleles Complex Expression Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Expression of Multiple Alleles Complex Expression Part 2 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;The examples we have looked at thus far, have only included genes with two alleles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many genes, however, have more than two alleles in the population - a situation referred to as multiple alleles.&amp;nbsp; Note - each diploid individual in the population is diploid can only have at most two different alleles - but in the entire population there can be more than two alleles. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fairly straightforward example of this is the human ABO blood group.&amp;nbsp; There are 3 alleles - the A allele (indicated with a capital I superscript A), the B allele (indicated with a capital I and a superscript B), and the O allele indicated with a lower case i.&amp;nbsp; Within this group there are two different dominance relationships.&amp;nbsp; We have already discussed how allele A and allele B are codominant to each other.&amp;nbsp; Both of these alleles (A and B), are completely dominant to allele O.&amp;nbsp; An individual who is heterozygous for A and O has blood type A.&amp;nbsp; Similarly for an individual who is heterozygous for B and O has blood type B.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;br&gt;Sometimes a gene can have an effect on more than one aspect of an organism's phenotype.&amp;nbsp; This situation is referred to as pleiotropy. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3&lt;br&gt;An example of pleiotropy is the frizzle gene in chickens.&amp;nbsp; This gene is referred to as "frizzle" because it results in frizzy looking feathers.&amp;nbsp; The gene that causes this phenotype also causes the chicken to have abnormal body temperature, higher metabolic and blood flow rates, and greater digestive capacity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a single gene, we will call it gene X, that has an impact on all of these aspects of the chicken's phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;Epistasis refers to a relationship between at least two different genes and one gene affects expression of another gene (or genes).&amp;nbsp; A common example of epistasis is coat color in mammals. The example we are looking at here is coat color in horses.&amp;nbsp; There are two different genes that play a role in determining coat color.&amp;nbsp; Gene B codes for pigment - with the dominant B allele coding for black coat color and the recessive b allele coding for a lighter brown coat color.&amp;nbsp; Gene C is epistatic on gene B (epistasis literally means "standing upon") - it determines whether or not gene B gets expressed.&amp;nbsp; The dominant C allele allows the pigment to be deposited - so a horse that has at least one copy of the C allele will be either black or brown.&amp;nbsp; The recessive c allele, on the other hand, blocks pigment deposition - any horse that has two copies of the c allele (is homozygous recessive for c) - will be a whitish color.&amp;nbsp; This is because gene C is epistatic on gene B and controls whether or not it is expressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;Epistasis and pleiotropy are often confused with each other but they are quite different.&amp;nbsp; One important difference is the number of genes involved.&amp;nbsp; Epistasis involves at least two genes but only one aspect of the phenotype is affected.&amp;nbsp; Coat color in horses is an example - two genes but only one character - coat color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pleiotropy involves a singe gene - but the gene impacts several aspects of the phenotype - like frizzled chickens with their different body temperature and metabolism.&amp;nbsp; A single gene caused all of these changes to the phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;Most genetic traits are not determined by a single gene - most traits are polygenic (the prefix poly means many).&amp;nbsp; Skin color in humans, for example, is a polygenic trait.&amp;nbsp; Here at Penn State, Dr. Mark Shriver in the department of anthropology is attempting to work out the exact number of genes that are responsible for skin color in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model organism that he uses to learn more about our pigment genes is actually a small species of fish known as a zebrafish (zebrfish are common lab organisms).&amp;nbsp; The gene that he is currently looking at is known as SLC24A5.&amp;nbsp; This gene plays a role in pigment production in both zebrafish and humans.&amp;nbsp; We know that there are other genes involved in skin color and other research groups around the world are looking at these genes.&amp;nbsp; Some day we may know all of the genes that are responsible for skin color in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Plants I Part 3 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Plants I Part 3 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;br&gt;We will now begin discussing the four main groups of plant diversity and we will start with the non-vascular plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The non-vascular plants were the first group of plants to evolve and they retain primitive characterstics such as a lack of vascular tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Non-vascular plants are sometimes referred to as the Bryophytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the non-vascular plants are not a monophyletic group and this classification system is being updated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All members of this group lack vascular tissue which means they hae no tissue to move water and nutrients around the body of the plant. &amp;nbsp;As a result, these plants remain small because they rely on passive diffusion to move water and nutrients around the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;This group of plants has no pollen, seeds, flowers or fruit and they reproduce via spores that are released from the parent plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plants are sexually reproducing organisms and they make gametes - both sperm and eggs. &amp;nbsp;The sperm of the non-vascular plants are flagellated and they need a moist environment so that they can swim to fertilize the egg of a female plant. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the nonvascular plants are found in moist environments - at least during their reproductive stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are anchored to the soil substrate that they grow on by structures known as rhizoids - these are not roots because true roots have vascular tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because they lack vascular tissue nutrients and water must diffuse into the cells of the plant. &amp;nbsp;This keeps the plant small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The non-vascular plants have an alternation of generation life cycle like all plants. &amp;nbsp;The non-vascular plants are unique in that the gametophyte is the prominent stage in the life cycle (all other plant groups have a prominent sporophyte).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 4&lt;br&gt;The non-vascular plants includes not only the mosses but also plants known as liverworts and hornworts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 5&lt;br&gt;There are about 12,000 species of mosses alone and they grow in shady wet environments like this beautiful and peaceful moss garden in Kyoto, Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 6&lt;br&gt;Recall that alternation of generations is a life cycle in which there is an alternation between a multicellular haploid and multicellular diploid stage in the life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The keyword here is multicellular - both the haploid and the diploid stage are multicellular. &amp;nbsp;This is in contrast to humans, for example, &amp;nbsp;We have a multicellular diploid stage but the haploid cells in the human life cycle only include the sperm and eggs and they are unicellular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diploid stage is the sporophyte and it produces the spores and the haploid stage is the gametophyte and it produces the gametes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial we will examine the alternation of generations life cycle in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we start with the multicellular diploid stage - the sporophyte...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We see that it creates spores via meiosis (spores are haploid).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 9&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These spores are released from the parent sporophyte and they germinate and grow via mitosis into a multicellular haploid gametophyte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gametophyte produces gametes - both eggs and sperm - via mitosis (remember, the gametophyte cells are haploid so they produce haploid gametes by mitosis).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 11&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fertilization of an egg by a sperm produces a diploid zygote and this zygote grows via mitosis into a new multicellular sporophyte individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternation of generations is a feature of all plants but it looks slightly different in the different types of plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 12&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the mosses and other non-vascular plants - it is the gametophyte that is prominent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a separate male and female gametophyte - the male produces sperm and the female produces eggs. &amp;nbsp;The sperm must swim to the egg and fertilization produces the diploid zygote. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The zygote grows into a sporophyte. &amp;nbsp;In the mosses this sporophyte is small and completely dependent on the gametophyte for nutrition (the sporophyte cannot photosynthesize).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what it means for the gametophyte to be prominent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sporophyte produces spores via meiosis and produces spores that will grow into new gametophytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The mosses are heterosporous - there are two different types of spores - one type gives rise to male gametophytes and one type gives rise to female gametophytes. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Plants II Part 4 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Plants II Part 4 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternation of generations in the pines is marked by a completely reduced gametophyte and completely prominent sporophyte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the conifers, such as a pine tree, are monoecious - male and female cones are found on the same tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The male cone produces the pollen and the female cone produces an egg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pollen must get to a female cone (typically on a different tree) for fertilization to take place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the sperm fertilizes the egg the zygote forms and grows into the multicellular sporophyte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This life cycle differs from vascular seedless plants because the embryo spends time housed within a seed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seed then germinates and grows into a new pine tree.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slide 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pines are monoecious - both male and female cones are found on the same tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this image the male pollen producing cones are on the bottom and the female egg producing cones are at the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Slide 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seeds that are produced by the pines and other gymnosperms are "naked" - they are not covered in fruit like the seeds of the angiosperms are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seeds come from the female cone and house the developing embryo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may have cooked with or eaten pine nuts - they are the seeds of pine trees.&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Energy I Part 3 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Energy I Part 3 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1 There are two laws of thermodynamics that will be important for you to understand so that you understand cellular metabolism. The first law of thermodynamics can be stated in several ways. We can say that the amount of energy in the universe is constant. Or we can say that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, but only converted from one form to another Another way to say this law is to sat that the energy used and released in any reaction must be balanced. Some people even describe this law as "there is no free lunch" - this means that energy must come from somewhere and it isn't free!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2 One of the goals of this course is to improve your critical thinking skills. This has relevance not only in the classroom but in your everyday life. There are always con artists who are willing to take your money through promises of miraculous medical cures or, as seen here, the promise of free electricity through the use of perpetual motion machines. Perpetual motion refers to the movement of a machine without any input of external energy. A basic scientific understanding of the first law of thermodynamics along with some critical thinking skills tells us that this is not possible! Perpetual motion is not physically possible here on earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3 The closest I have come to believing in perpetual motion is when watching my Chihuahua Speedy. As you can see in this picture - he is blurry because he never stops moving! But I have to feed him so even with a Chihuahua there is no such thing as a free lunch or pepetual motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4 The Second Law of Thermodynamics refers to the tendency of the universe to tend toward disorder. Like the first law, it can be stated in many different ways. We can say that matter is becoming more random. Or we can point out that entropy is increasing in the universe. Entropy is a measure of disorder. Another way of stating the second law is to say that all energy in the universe is tending toward heat. Heat is the most random form of energy. But it may be best to think about the second law in terms of familiar observations. This image shows a nice red shed. If no energy is put into maintaining this shed it will fall into disarray as disorder or entropy increases. To return the shed to good order - energy must be put into the system. This shed is a good analogy for our cells and our bodies. If we do not take in energy to do cell work and maintain our cells and bodies - we fall into disrepair. As work is done on the shed or as we do cellular work - heat is returned to the environment. As the most random form of energy - this heat is not useful to drive biological processes. Luckily we have a constant input of energy into the biosphere in the form of sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5 Our sun provides energy to plants and other photosynthetic organisms. These organisms produce high energy compounds such as glucose that provide energy to all other organims. So, as long as the sun is shining on earth - we will have energy that we can use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6 But what happens when the sun stops shining....&lt;/p&gt;</body>

    <title>Animals I Part 5 VoiceThread Transcript</title>
    <body>&lt;h2&gt;Animals I Part 5 VoiceThread Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 1 We are now ready to look at our first representative of the bilateria. All members of the bilateria are triplobastic and they all show a feature known as cephalization. Cephalization is the concentration of sensory and nervous tissue in a distinct head region (notice that neither the sponges nor the cnidarians have a distinct head). All of the bilateria have a distinct head - at least during certain stages of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 2 The bilateria are also divided into either acoelomates, coelomates, or pseudocoelomates. The first group we will look at are the acoelomates - those members of the bilateria that do not have a body cavity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 3 Our representative group of acoelomates are the Platyhelminthes - also known as the flatworms. This image of a flatworm clearly shows the cephalization that is a feature of the bilateria. We see eyespots at the head end of this organism. This organism also has what is known as an incomplete digestive tract. This means that there is just a single opening into the digestive tract - this structure here known as a pharynx. It serves as both a mouth and an anus. These organisms, like the sponges and cnidarians, are essentially aquatic. However, the aquatic environment they live in may be the fluids inside another organism because the flatworms can be either free-living or parasitic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 4 Tapeworms are an example of a parasitic flatworm. Tapeworms parasitize the digestive trace of vertebrate animals - including humans. They are specialized for this mode of life - the scolex is a specialized structure for attaching to the intestinal wall of their host. This image shows the suckers and hooks of the scolex. The rest of the worms body is made up of proglottids - specialized reproductive structures that contain both male and female reproductive structures. Tapeworms are very good at removing nutrients from the host organism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 5 For this reason, they were marketed as a diet aid in the 1900-1920s. While it is true that people who are infected with tapeworms often lose weight - they also lose essential nutrients and can become quite ill. There are better ways to lose weight!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 6 Globally, one of the most important flatworm diseases is schistosoma. This organism infects about 200 million people in 75 countries - mainly in Africa and Asia. It is second only to malaria in prevalence of infectious diseases. Approximately 1 million people die of this infection each year. The worm lives in the blood stream &amp; tissues of the host and is unique among flatworms in that there are separate males and females. In this image you can see a female with a copulatory groove that accommodates a male. They copulate and produce offspring while they float through their hosts blood stream. These organisms have a complex life cycle that involves not just humans but snails as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 7 Areas that lack good sanitation often have human fecal material in the water. This can be a source of infection as the eggs pass out of feces and into the water where they hatch and then infect a snail. The larva then emerge from the snail and penetrate a person's skin. Efforts to control this infection involve both improved sanitation as well as snail population control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 8 You may recognize the freshwater flatworm known as Planaria. It is a common inhabitant of pond water and is often used in biology laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slide 9 There are also beautiful marine representatives of this group. Complex life cycle&lt;/p&gt;</body>
